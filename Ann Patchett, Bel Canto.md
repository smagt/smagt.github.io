Bel Canto by Ann Patchett, and somewhere long the read I realised this was the second book of the same author that I read recently; the first was The Dutch House which I loved.  Did you see this recent(?) Stockholm Syndrome movie?  I loved it, it felt so recognisable.  At least the bank employees there.  None of that in this book: a famous soprano gives a private concert to a number of important industry C* people and politicians, and then the whole group gets hostaged.  
  
Is that a word, hostaged?  Hosted wouldn't quite cover it.    
The situation becomes permanent, almost through the whole book, and slowly the story develops to one of love, sex (one love story, where you hope that the kidnapper gets away with it so that she can continue her love with a kidnapped), arts, with nice character development.    
  
Still, the book does not go so deep that I would find it non-superficial.  I did find it thus, while liking it at the same time as a good story.  The end is as hostages end, with a then somewhat surprising finale.  Still: lightyears away from The Dutch House.
