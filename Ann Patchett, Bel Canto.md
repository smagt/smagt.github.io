Did you see this Stockholm Syndrome movie?  About the bank robbery in Stockholm, upon which the term is based.  I loved it, it felt so recognisable.  Or least I could identify well with the bank employees there.    
  
"Bel Canto" describes a hostage situation at a birthday party in an unnamed South American country. The event is in honor of Mr. Hosokawa, a Japanese businessman, and features a performance by famous soprano Roxane Coss. Terrorists interrupt the party, taking everyone hostage to push their political agenda.  
  
Over the months, hostages and captors form unexpected relationships. Music becomes a key element, bringing people together despite their different backgrounds. Central to the story are the developing bonds, especially between Roxane and Mr. Hosokawa.  
  
Sex, violence, and arts. Including one love story, where you hope that the kidnapper gets away with it so that she can continue her love with a kidnapped.  
  
Good story, superficially developed, and the book ends with the hostage with a then somewhat surprising finale.
