description: As Zimbabwe emerges into independence, Tambudzai Sigauke embarks on her second year at the Young Ladies' College of the Sacred Heart. Determined to excel, Tambu exhausts herself with her efforts to climb to the top of the school's honour rolls. The further she pushes herself, however, the farther she feels from any reward; and the roots of colonialism threaten to trip her at every step. The sequel to Nervous Conditions is as moving, darkly witty, and riveting as its predecessor.

Following up on _Nervous Conditions_, the book again baffles.  Again Rhodesia, and the civil war is raging in the country.  Some family members get hurt, but Tambu is away in her convent, in school, and failing to reach her self-set academic goals.  That makes her life dreams fall apart, very slowly.    
  
To me it was unclear if this was because of herself, or rather – as I suspected – of the apartheid ruling in the country.  The reader never knows, and Tambu never really wonders.    
  
Again a quite beautiful book.
