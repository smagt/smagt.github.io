# about cq. imprint

This is a simple blog by Patrick van der Smagt.  It contains things he wants to get out but did not find a scientific or other venue to do so.  

If you think that there are any opinions in this blog, these are by Patrick only, by himself and by him.  In this blog, he does not speak for any other person, any legal entity, or anything but himself.  He tries to be respectful, but if you think he misstepped, please reach out and tell him; he will most certainly mend his ways.

Where needed please contact Patrick on, e.g., [linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/smagt/), or use one of his email addresses.
