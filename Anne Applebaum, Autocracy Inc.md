description: "From the Pulitzer-prize winning, New York Times bestselling author, an alarming account of how autocracies work together to undermine the democratic world, and how we should organize to defeat them We think we know what an autocratic state looks like: There is an all-powerful leader at the top. He controls the police. The police threaten the people with violence. There are evil collaborators, and maybe some brave dissidents. But in the 21st century, that bears little resemblance to reality. Nowadays, autocracies are underpinned not by one dictator, but by sophisticated networks composed of kleptocratic financial structures, surveillance technologies, and professional propagandists, all of which operate across multiple regimes, from China to Russia to Iran. Corrupt companies in one country do business with corrupt companies in another. The police in one country can arm and train the police in another, and propagandists share resources and themes, pounding home the same messages about the weakness of democracy and the evil of America. International condemnation and economic sanctions cannot move the autocrats. Even popular opposition movements, from Venezuela to Hong Kong to Moscow, don't stand a chance. The members of Autocracy, Inc, aren't linked by a unifying ideology, like communism, but rather a common desire for power, wealth, and impunity. In this urgent treatise, which evokes George Kennan's essay calling for &quot;containment&quot; of the Soviet Union, Anne Applebaum calls for the democracies to fundamentally reorient their policies to fight a new kind of threat."

Having lived in Europe, or at least in democracies, all my life, and being in despair of how democracies are progressing, this book is for me.  Even if, normally, I prefer novels over non-fiction books, since the latter are normally too repetitive, too long-winded, and too anti-climax for me.  
  
But Anne Applebaum already got her Pulitzer prize, so all good.  Right?  
  
Indeed.  This book, recommended to me by a dear friend, is not repetitive, does not want to teach you, does not want to sell itself beyond its value.  
  
In recent years I've been trying to keep up to date, at a very superficial level, of happenings in Russia, Hungary, some African countries.  Autocracies.  And yes, indeed; the cold-war separation of communist vs. capitalist is gone.  It's now democratic vs. autocratic. And even that is not true.  
  
By discussing China, Russia, Venezuela, Zimbabwe, and other autocracies in detail, Applebaum highlights how collaborations between these states, or their autocrats, influence public opinion, manipulate (social) media, amass wealth, solidify their positions, and undermine democracy.  It is impressive (depressive; repressive; suppressive) work, and counteracting, so Applebaum argues, now only works on creating international networks of democratic states who change their rules in, e.g., financial markets.  
  
It feels a bit as if democracies are going to lose this struggle.  Luckily, analyses like these allow us to come to terms and act.  
  
Don't let this book go unheeded.
