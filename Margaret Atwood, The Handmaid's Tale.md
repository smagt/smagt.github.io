Published in 1985 (why did I wait so long??), this book describes a dystopian society, the Republic of Gilead, which has overthrown the all-too-liberal US government. The main character, Offred, tells the story and is a "Handmaid", assigned to produce children for the "Commanders", the ruling class in Gilead. Handmaids are those few women who are still fertile, after pollution and radiation made those rare.

As Piet Hein wrote,
	_Everything's either  
	concave or -vex,  
	so whatever you dream  
	will be something with sex._
	
Then, there are the Aunts, who train the handmaids, and the Marthas, who take care of the household.  

Offred's goal is an escape to Canada. She remembers her life before Gilead, and yearns for freedom. 

The narrative is immersive, descriptive and introspective, and is told from Offred's perspective. The book uses a non-linear narrative structure with frequent flashbacks and interjections of Offred's thoughts and feelings. Atwood uses imagery, symbolism, and metaphors to let you feel the grim reality of this oppressive world. Her prose is stark yet poetic, filled with subtle irony and dark humor. The book uses satire to critique patriarchal norms and societal constructs.

Did I like it?  Yes, I think I did.  In fact, I am quite sure I did.  But it did take me a bit by surprise, as I did not expect. 

The story ends ambiguously. After Offred finishes her story, she is taken away by men dressed in the uniform of the secret police. Is she safe now?  Is she taken into custody, or worse? And then, the epilogue surprises again: the book, we learn, is in fact a transcript of recordings on cassette tapes An academic, Dr. Pieixoto, explains that the novel we have read is a transcript of a tape recording, discovered many years after the Gileadean era has come to an end. But what about Offred?
