description: The overall effect is like a brilliantly well-informed 200-year history of philosophy, science, music and mysticism, touched with an edge of Da Vinci Code hocus pocus, in the sense of an alternative "sub rosa" world history never quite revealed. To say so, though, is to miss the sheer fun and narrative energy of Crumey's writing, the skill and insight with which he conjures up each of his narrators from the repellent to the poignant, and the huge ingenuity with which he interweaves their stories, including that of Adam Crouch, a failed writer and memorably seedy 21st century buffoon, who enters the story by accident, and becomes its final boozed-up witness to timeless tragedy. There's something profoundly post-modern about the dense cultural references, and the complex patchwork of fact and fiction, that make up Crumey's narrative; and in that sense it continues in a vein he has been mining for the last 25 years and more. The intensity with which the story questions the very nature of time, though - and follows its central voice, Robert Coyle, through the strange reality-shifting nightmare of the pandemic - seems entirely of this moment; as if Crumey were leading us into a terminal vortex of history and thought, music and culture, parallel universes and competing realities, where all things sparkle and implode with extraordinary vividness, on the edge of oblivion.'

I've always liked van Beethoven's music. Now, knowing it (almost) all, and perhaps understanding his artistic development a bit, I don't go back to it very often, but when I do, it's relaxing and inspiring.  
  
And thus I expected the same of this book. Its main character is a novelist, who was asked to write an article about “Beethoven and Philosophy”. Covid comes; he struggles with his dementing father and his mother's death. In a second storyline, playing after the pandemic, he goes to a writing retreat in a Scottish country house where he rubs against other people and some mysteries there, while trying to continue writing the article. There are other storylines set in the same house at different times. For instance, in 1823 the house is owned by a retired colonel connected to the masonic lodge who commissioned "the opera". In 1923, the house is a psychiatric hospital visited by J.W.N. Sullivan, who in real life was an expert on Beethoven and physics. Sullivan investigates a woman able to recall past lives, and learns about the opera.  
  
And then there is Therese van Beethoven, Ludwig's sister-in-law who complains about the old deaf sod, and takes care of him in his final hours. Giving a believable picture of how "this old sod" really lived and died.  
  
But... "The opera"? Which opera? Well, that is the central thing in this book: the Beethoven opera about the Order of Assassins, titled "The Assassins, or Everything is Allowed". We know, of course, that the opera never came to be. But the book at least finds the libretto, and some mysteries around it.  
  
The book is highly amusing, I found. Probably since I recognised some things. It's also non-consequential, since that opera... it really did not exist. I heard before that, having written only one opera was a pain for Beethoven -- and indeed, one with a libretto which does not live up to the music.  
  
But still, I enjoyed the stories in the book, combining suspense, history, and personal stories in one.
