After finishing 'All The Light We Cannot See', I very swiftly, in the matter of seconds, moved to this book and completely relaxed. Yes, I love van Beethoven's music. (No; the "van" points to his Belgian ancestry, indeed his grandfather.) Yes, I do have Beethoven's conversation books, and I once read Thayer's biography of the same. Very long ago, but still.

So, this book, as silly as it is, sounded with me. Main character is a novelist, living now, who was asked to write an article about “Beethoven and Philosophy”. Covid comes; he struggles with his dementing father and his mother's death. In another storyline, playing after the pandemic, he goes to a writing retreat in a Scottish country house where he rubs against other people and some mysteries there, while trying to continue writing the article. There are other storylines set in the same house at different times. In 1823 the house is owned by a retired colonel connected to the masonic lodge who commissioned the opera. In 1923 the house is a psychiatric hospital visited by J.W.N. Sullivan, who in real life was an expert on Beethoven and physics. Sullivan investigates a woman able to recall past lives, and learns about the opera.

And then there is Therese van Beethoven, Ludwig's sister-in-law who complains about the old deaf sod, and takes care of him in his final hours. Giving a believable picture of how "this old sod" really lived and died.

But... "The opera"? Which opera? Well, that is the central thing in this book: the Beethoven opera about the Order of Assassins, titled "The Assassins, or Everything is Allowed". We know, of course, that the opera never came to be. But the book at least finds the libretto, and some mysteries around it.

The book is highly amusing, I found. Probably since I recognised some things. It's also non-consequential, since that opera... it really did not exist. I heard before that, having written only one opera was a pain for Beethoven – and indeed, one with a quite sub-par libretto. 

But still, I enjoyed the stories in the book, combining suspense, history, and personal stories in one.
