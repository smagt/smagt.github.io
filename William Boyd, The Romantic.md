description: "From the award-winning, internationally best-selling author, a beguiling romp of a novel, at once intimate and panoramic, about the adventures and misadventures of a nineteenth-century everyman: Picaresque, big-hearted and moving, this is Boyd at the top of his game. —The Guardian One man, many livesx Cashel Greville Ross experiences more of everything than most, from the rapturous to the devastating, from surprising good luck to unexpected loss. Born in 1799, Cashel seeks his fortune across the turbulence of multiple continents, from County Cork to rural Massachusetts, from Waterloo to Zanzibar, embedded with the East Indian Army in Sri Lanka, sunning himself alongside the Romantic poets in Pisa. He travels the world as a soldier, a farmer, a felon, a writer, even a father. And he experiences all the vicissitudes of existence, including a once-in-a-lifetime love that will haunt the rest of his days. In the end, his great accomplishment is to discover who he truly is—which is the romance of life itself, and the beating heart of The Romantic."

Another book I forgot.  It was something historic, but what?  After refreshing my mind: this book is about Cashel Greville Ross (1799–1882), an adventurer who joins the luscious society of Shelley and Byron; discovers the source of the Nile; is a soldier in India; owns a farm and introduces lager in Massachusetts; is a best-selling author and ends up in jail for financial fraud, in fact by his publisher; is the bastard son of a count or earl, and lives good by that; is involved in smuggling antiques from Egypt; but in reality all his life tries to reconnect with his eternal love, Countess Raphaelle Rezzo.  A long, rich, fulfilling life, after which one gets the feeling, _that_'s a life worth living! (but I am happy I am not he).

A wildly entertaining story, and that is almost all what matters in this book.  And totally irrelevant.

Ross dies, alone, in a train station, if I remember correctly just having left countess Rezzo.  Active to the last minute.  Way to go.
