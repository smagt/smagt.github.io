description: "From the award-winning, internationally best-selling author, a beguiling romp of a novel, at once intimate and panoramic, about the adventures and misadventures of a nineteenth-century everyman: Picaresque, big-hearted and moving, this is Boyd at the top of his game. —The Guardian One man, many livesx Cashel Greville Ross experiences more of everything than most, from the rapturous to the devastating, from surprising good luck to unexpected loss. Born in 1799, Cashel seeks his fortune across the turbulence of multiple continents, from County Cork to rural Massachusetts, from Waterloo to Zanzibar, embedded with the East Indian Army in Sri Lanka, sunning himself alongside the Romantic poets in Pisa. He travels the world as a soldier, a farmer, a felon, a writer, even a father. And he experiences all the vicissitudes of existence, including a once-in-a-lifetime love that will haunt the rest of his days. In the end, his great accomplishment is to discover who he truly is—which is the romance of life itself, and the beating heart of The Romantic."

A fictitious history novel describing the life of Cashel Greville Ross (1799–1882), an adventurer who joins the luscious society of Shelley and Byron; discovers the source of the Nile; is a soldier in India; owns a farm and introduces lager in Massachusetts; is a best-selling author and ends up in jail for fraud; is the bastard son of a count or earl, and lives good by that; is involved in smuggling antiques from Egypt; but in reality all his life tries to reconnect with his eternal love, Countess Raphaelle Rezzo. A long, rich, fulfilling life, after which one gets the feeling, _that_'s a life worth living!  
  
The book opens with Cashel already thinking he's met his end:  
  
_Cashel always claimed that his first memory was of a man in black, leading a black horse. A man who – he then suspected – wanted to kill him, for some reason. This occurred when he was about four or five or six years old (he would vaguely recall) and the encounter took place when he was mooching around late one wintry afternoon in the big copse behind the cottage where he lived in County Cork, Ireland. He heard distant hunting horns and snatched halloos from the fields beyond and then, closer to hand at the fringes of the copse, out of sight, came a thrashing and snapping of vegetation, of something sizeable pushing and forcing its way through the undergrowth._  
  
A wildly entertaining story, and that is almost all what matters in this book. And totally irrelevant.  
  
Ross dies, alone, in a train station, after just having left countess Rezzo:  
  
_It was Ignatz Vlac who tracked Cashel down. Before quitting Baden-Baden, Cashel had telegraphed, as promised, to say he was leaving and hoped to be in Venice within the next twenty-four hours or so. He gave no details about which route he would take. There was no need to be met at the station, he instructed._  
  
And thus ended a life, active to the last minute. One can only be jealous. But perhaps more of the author: a superbly told story, and a great read.
