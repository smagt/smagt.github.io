I've been in Scotland more than a few times. I've seen and wandered through Glasgow, I've seen and "tasted" northern England. So I can picture the scenes this book describes, in parts at least.    So I could well imagine the gritty realities of life in 1980s Glasgow. With its unflinching portrayal of poverty, addiction, and the (stifling?) bonds of family.  
  
Hugh "Shuggie" Bain, a sensitive teenager, is the son of a heavy-drinking mother, a runaway father, and siblings who can't cope with that. It's a long string of misery, and despite being 40 years ago, it feels as if it could be today.  Shuggie's mum, Agnes, remains proud throughout her struggle.  Which includes sleeping around for a few pounds or pints; abused by everyone around her except for Shuggie; poverty, illness, contempt, cold.  Estranged children, husbands.  A downward spiral.    
  
Shuggie Bain's character is the heart of the novel. His rock-steady love and loyalty to his mother, despite her many failings, is heartbreaking and maddening. Shuggie's struggles with his own identity, including his burgeoning awareness of his sexuality. He experiences bullying and isolation, and fights to rise above his circumstances.  
  
Is it bleak?  Or is it hopeful?  One never really knows in this book.  The love between Shuggie and his mother Agnes, despite its dysfunction, gives a glimmer of light in an otherwise dark world.  
  
Sad story, therein beautiful, and enjoyable or impressive. A recommended read.
