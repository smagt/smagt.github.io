description: BY THE WINNER OF THE 2021 NOBEL PRIZE IN LITERATURE SHORTLISTED FOR THE 2021 ORWELL PRIZE FOR POLITICAL FICTION LONGLISTED FOR THE 2021 WALTER SCOTT PRIZE 'Riveting and heartbreaking ... A compelling novel, one that gathers close all those who were meant to be forgotten, and refuses their erasure' Maaza Mengiste, Guardian 'A brilliant and important book for our times, by a wondrous writer' Philippe Sands, New Statesman, Books of the Year _______________ While he was still a little boy, Ilyas was stolen from his parents by the German colonial troops. After years away, fighting in a war against his own people, he returns to his village to find his parents gone, and his sister Afiya given away. Another young man returns at the same time. Hamza was not stolen for the war, but sold into it; he has grown up at the right hand of an officer whose protection has marked him life. With nothing but the clothes on his back, he seeks only work and security â€“ and the love of the beautiful Afiya. As fate knots these young people together, as they live and work and fall in love, the shadow of a new war on another continent lengthens and darkens, ready to snatch them up and carry them away... _______________ 'One of the world's most prominent postcolonial writers ... He has consistently and with great compassion penetrated the effects of colonialism in East Africa and its effects on the lives of uprooted and migrating individuals' Anders Olsson, chairman of the Nobel Committee 'In book after book, he guides us through seismic historic moments and devastating societal ruptures while gently outlining what it is that keeps those families, friendships and loving spaces intact, if not fully whole' Maaza Mengiste 'Rarely in a lifetime can you open a book and find that reading it encapsulates the enchanting qualities of a love affair ... One scarcely dares breathe while reading it for fear of breaking the enchantment' The Times

A beautiful book, and hard to retell as it is a complex one.  Hamza comes back, after the war, to the area in Ethiopia or Kenya where he grew up. The war is lost by the Germans, but he is far away enough from his service in that war that it does not haunt him.

But he does speak German, and can read and write it well.  And that makes him stand out, and allows him to grow from the simple job as carpenter assistant to a prominent one, even being allowed to live in his boss' home where he then also courts and marries the girl living there, who is a distant relative of the boss.

Beyond its historical backdrop, 'Afterlives' delves deeply into themes of identity, redemption, and the search for belonging in a post-colonial Africa. Hamza's ability to navigate the complexities of his new life, leveraging his linguistic skills, symbolises the broader struggles of individuals striving to find their place amidst the remnants of colonial rule. His relationship with his wife and the dynamics within his boss' household further illuminate the intricate web of societal and familial expectations, offering a microcosm of the larger societal changes at play.

The narrative is enriched by its supporting characters, each bringing their own stories of loss and hope. Through these characters, the author explores the afterlives of not just individuals but of cultures and traditions, painting a vivid picture of a society in transition. The book's exploration of the impact of colonialism and war on personal and collective identities invites readers to reflect on the enduring legacies of history on present-day realities.

'Afterlives' is a testament to the power of storytelling in bridging past and present, joining memories and aspirations around the complexities of life in a post-war, post-colonial Africa.
