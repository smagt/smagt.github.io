description: BY THE WINNER OF THE 2021 NOBEL PRIZE IN LITERATURE SHORTLISTED FOR THE 2021 ORWELL PRIZE FOR POLITICAL FICTION LONGLISTED FOR THE 2021 WALTER SCOTT PRIZE 'Riveting and heartbreaking ... A compelling novel, one that gathers close all those who were meant to be forgotten, and refuses their erasure' Maaza Mengiste, Guardian 'A brilliant and important book for our times, by a wondrous writer' Philippe Sands, New Statesman, Books of the Year _______________ While he was still a little boy, Ilyas was stolen from his parents by the German colonial troops. After years away, fighting in a war against his own people, he returns to his village to find his parents gone, and his sister Afiya given away. Another young man returns at the same time. Hamza was not stolen for the war, but sold into it; he has grown up at the right hand of an officer whose protection has marked him life. With nothing but the clothes on his back, he seeks only work and security – and the love of the beautiful Afiya. As fate knots these young people together, as they live and work and fall in love, the shadow of a new war on another continent lengthens and darkens, ready to snatch them up and carry them away... _______________ 'One of the world's most prominent postcolonial writers ... He has consistently and with great compassion penetrated the effects of colonialism in East Africa and its effects on the lives of uprooted and migrating individuals' Anders Olsson, chairman of the Nobel Committee 'In book after book, he guides us through seismic historic moments and devastating societal ruptures while gently outlining what it is that keeps those families, friendships and loving spaces intact, if not fully whole' Maaza Mengiste 'Rarely in a lifetime can you open a book and find that reading it encapsulates the enchanting qualities of a love affair ... One scarcely dares breathe while reading it for fear of breaking the enchantment' The Times

East Africa, partly during but mostly just after world war I.  Ilyas, who is kidnapped as a child by German colonial troops; Afiya, who is rescued from a life of servitude; and Hamza, a young man who joins the German army. Gurnah’s portrayal of these characters is both tender and honest, offering a lively and relatable depiction of their struggles, resilience, and building up their lives in the mess Europeans made.  
  
Hamza comes back after the war, to the area in Ethiopia or Kenya where he grew up. The war is lost by the Germans, but he is far away enough from his service in that war that it does not affect him.  
  
But he does speak German, and can read and write it well.  And that makes him stand out, and allows him to grow from the simple job as carpenter assistant to a prominent one, even being allowed to live in his boss' home where he then also courts and marries the girl living there, who is a distant relative of the boss.  
  
Gurnah mixes personal with historical fiction.  Lots of detail, and that gives a picture of a changing world, still suffering from colonialism yet also going towards a more humane future.  
  
*Afterlives* is notable for its discussing the impact of German colonialism in Africa. Gurnah sheds light on this period with, as far as I could reconstruct, historical accuracy, making this part of African history discussable.  
  
A beautiful book, and hard to retell as it is a complex one.
