He was a gluttonous man and when his blood came out it looked like the blood of a pig. That's a cruel thing to think, I know. He did it in a restaurant where I was having dinner with another man, another married man. Do you see how this is going? But I wasn't always that way. I am depraved.

For me it is a rare thing when a book is a straight page turner. For this book, when cycling through the park, one day I stopped and sat down to read for half an hour. Or once, waking up in the middle of the night from some noise, I did not go back to sleep but back to this book.  

I still don't understand why. Yes, I am reading another book by this wonderful author, and I love it, too. But still?  

Amal describes the silent, slow revenge a young (or not so young; she describes herself younger than she is) woman on men. All men in her life, her boyfriends, her lovers, her acquaintances, and foremost her father. And, she does it in such a way that I feel bad about what other men did to her. Or what she let other men do to her. And at the same time, how this is normal, in a way.  

It's not a book about \#metoo. Don't get me wrong. It's a book about relationships, about sex, about how some things must be as they are (or not?) Perhaps about, how we must be conscious about our choices or so.  

I can't describe it. I'd need to be a writer to do so correctly. Read it and tell me, I got it all wrong. I'd appreciate that.
