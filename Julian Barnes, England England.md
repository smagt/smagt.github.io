description: Shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize for Fiction As every schoolboy knows, you can fit the whole of England on the Isle of Wight. Grotesque, visionary tycoon Sir Jack Pitman takes the saying literally and does exactly that. He constructs on the island 'The Project', a vast heritage centre containing everything 'English', from Big Ben to Stonehenge, from Manchester United to the white cliffs of Dover. The project is monstrous, risky, and vastly successful. In fact, it gradually begins to rival 'Old' England and even threatens to supersede it... One of Barnes's finest and funniest novels, England, England calls into question the idea of replicas, truth vs fiction, reality vs art, nationhood, myth-making, and self-exploration. 'A brilliant, Swiftian fantasy' The Economist

I may not be English enough.  Julian Barnes' major works include "Metroland" (1980), "Flaubert's Parrot" (1984), "A History of the World in 10½ Chapters" (1989), "England, England" (1998), and "The Sense of an Ending" (2011), which won the Man Booker Prize. Other notable works are "Arthur & George" (2005), "The Noise of Time" (2016), "The Only Story" (2018), and "Elizabeth Finch" (2022). These works showcase Barnes' range from historical and biographical fiction to explorations of love, truth, and existential inquiries.  
  
The History of the World was the first book I read, and got me hooked on him. Or rather, The sense of an ending did, about a Cambridge menage-a-trois-which-wasn't. Especially the latter book, which I read when travelling in Venice, is one of those books I will never forget.  
  
Flaubert's Parrot I liked.  Metroland I forgot.  Authur & George I liked, then forgot. As Elisabeth Finch.  
  
But England, England? II tried to start, restart and then finish England, England.  The first Barnes I really cannot swallow, and did not finish.  Perhaps because of Brexit that my love for the Brits was at freezing point.  The book irritates me.   And since it was shortlisted for the Booker prize, it's me, not the book.
