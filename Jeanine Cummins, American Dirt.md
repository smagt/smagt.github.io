It's a story of Mexican refugees, a mother and her son, the others being killed by the cartel.  They flee, heartbreaking story... but too cheap, too easy to feel pity for them, etc.  I decided to read a bit about this prize-winning novel, and found lots of criticism: written by upper-class US about Mexican refugees?  It is too cheesy.  I dumped it after a short while.  My rating is unfair, as I did not finish.
