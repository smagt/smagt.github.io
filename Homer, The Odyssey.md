description: A New York Times Notable Book of 2018 "Wilson’s language is fresh, unpretentious and lean…It is rare to find a translation that is at once so effortlessly easy to read and so rigorously considered." —Madeline Miller, author of Circe Composed at the rosy-fingered dawn of world literature almost three millennia ago, The Odyssey is a poem about violence and the aftermath of war; about wealth, poverty and power; about marriage and family; about travelers, hospitality, and the yearning for home. This fresh, authoritative translation captures the beauty of this ancient poem as well as the drama of its narrative. Its characters are unforgettable, none more so than the “complicated” hero himself, a man of many disguises, many tricks, and many moods, who emerges in this version as a more fully rounded human being than ever before. Written in iambic pentameter verse and a vivid, contemporary idiom, Emily Wilson’s Odyssey sings with a voice that echoes Homer’s music; matching the number of lines in the Greek original, the poem sails along at Homer’s swift, smooth pace. A fascinating, informative introduction explores the Bronze Age milieu that produced the epic, the poem’s major themes, the controversies about its origins, and the unparalleled scope of its impact and influence. Maps drawn especially for this volume, a pronunciation glossary, and extensive notes and summaries of each book make this is an Odyssey that will be treasured by a new generation of readers.

A new translation of the Odyssey, by Emily Wilson, published in 2017.  This is the first time I am reading the 'original' book; of course, the story I know, and I've read some versions around this epic.  
  
To be honest it took me a while to purchase.  Do I really want to read a 700-page long, 3000-year old book?  Is it at least palatable, a good read?  Will I have my _Ulysses_ moment?  And, it's in verse, duh, can I cope with that?  
  
Well, I did buy it.  And I'm not going to bore you with a short version of the story.  You probably know it.  But did you know that Homer, the author of this book, was probably not a person?  Or perhaps was?  But could have been a group of people, or anything that works?  That, and other analyses of the book create the prologue of this vast volume, and already is an entertaining read.  
  
And so the book begins.  
  
_Tell me about a complicated man._  
_Muse, tell me how he wandered and was lost_  
_when he had wrecked the holy town of Troy,_  
_and where he went, and who he met, the pain_  
_he suffered in the storms at sea, and how_  
_he worked to save his life and bring his men_  
_back home. He failed to keep them safe; poor fools,_  
_they ate the Sun God’s cattle, and the god_  
_kept them from home. Now goddess, child of Zeus,_  
_tell the old story for our modern times._  
_Find the beginning._  
  
Oh, I can read that!  One of the most striking features of Wilson’s translation is her commitment to clarity and readability. Instead of using an archaic and elaborate style, Wilson takes a direct, modern approach, using precise language.  While preserving the story's accessibility poetic nature.  
  
And also, in the translation, Odysseus is not all good, presenting him as a complex and multifaceted hero. Her translation clearly showed the ambiguity of his decisions and the consequences of his homecoming.  
  
_Odysseus ripped off his rags. Now naked,_  
_he leapt upon the threshold with his bow_  
_and quiverfull of arrows, which he tipped_  
_out in a rush before his feet, and spoke._  
_“Playtime is over. I will shoot again,_  
_towards another mark no man has hit._  
_Apollo, may I manage it!”_  
_He aimed his deadly arrow at Antinous._  
_The young man sat there, just about to lift_  
_his golden goblet, swirling wine around,_  
_ready to drink. He had no thought of death._  
_How could he? Who would think a single man,_  
_among so many banqueters, would dare_  
_to risk dark death, however strong he was?_  
_Odysseus aimed at his throat, then shot._  
_The point pierced all the way through his soft neck._  
_He flopped down to the side and his cup slipped_  
_out of his hand, and then thick streams of blood_  
_gushed from his nostrils. His foot twitched and knocked_  
_the table down; food scattered on the ground._  
_The bread and roasted meat were soiled with blood._  
  
I loved this book.
