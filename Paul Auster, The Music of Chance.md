description: By the time Nashe understood what was happening to him, he was past the point of wanting it to end... Paul Auster fuses Samuel Beckett, Franz Kafka and The Brothers Grimm in this brilliant and unsettling parable. Following the death of his father, Jim Nashe takes to the open road in pursuit of a life of freedom. But as the money runs out he finds that his sense of disillusionment has only been compounded by his year on the road. However, after picking up Pozzi, a hitchhiking gambler, Nashe finds himself drawn into a dangerous game of high-stakes poker with two eccentric and reclusive millionaires.

Magic realism at its best.  The main character, Jim Nashe, and Pozzi, a hitchhiking gambler, join forces in setting up a top scam, a "sure fire" gig by winning poker against two lotto-rich men.  To do so, Pozzi uses a start capital, given to him by Jim, and.... loses the game.  
  
The punishment, to repay their debt, is as if from a Seinfeld episode.  The two need to build a medieval wall, the stones of which were imported from the UK, in the garden.  As the building continues, so does the drama.  Will they ever be released alive?  
  
The story has an absurd quality, but, as Auster goes: a good and strong story, and a lovely read.
