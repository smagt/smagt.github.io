description: "THE NUMBER ONE BESTSELLERThe list he left had just one item on it. Or, at least, it did at first... Mabel Beaumont’s husband Arthur loved lists. He’d leave them for her everywhere. ‘Remember: eggs, butter, sugar’. ‘I love you: today, tomorrow, always’. But now Arthur is gone. He died: softly, gently, not making a fuss. But he’s still left her a list. This one has just one item on it though: ‘Find D’. Mabel feels sure she knows what it means. She must track down her best friend Dot, who she hasn’t seen since the fateful day she left more than sixty years ago. It seems impossible. She doesn’t even know if Dot’s still alive. Also, every person Mabel talks to seems to need help first, with missing husbands, daughters, parents. Mabel finds her list is just getting longer, and she’s still no closer to finding Dot. What she doesn’t know is that her list isn’t just about finding her old friend. And that if she can admit the secrets of the past, maybe she could even find happiness again... A completely heartbreaking, beautiful, uplifting story, guaranteed to make you smile but also make you cry. Perfect for fans of A Man Called Ove, Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine, and The Keeper of Stories. Readers are loving The Last List of Mabel Beaumont: ‘Tender and beautiful... As hopeful as it is heart-breaking... I loved it.’ Amy Beashel ‘This beautifully written story of friendship, love, loss and second chances captured my heart. I adored Mabel and her unlikely gang of colourful characters... Leaves you feeling warm, hopeful, and satisfied.’ Lisa Timoney ‘Mabel Beaumont is an absolute treasure... Laura Pearson cleverly, gently, peels back the layers of Mabel’s and her friends’ lives in a way that hurts, then soothes, your heart... An uplifting, life-affirming joy of a novel!’ Emma Robinson ‘I’ve been inundated with books in the uplit genre but this is by far the best I’ve read... moving, life-affirming and utterly wonderful.’ Matt Cain ‘I absolutely loved this book... I adore an older protagonist... who is feisty and not afraid to speak her mind. The story is like a warm hug – but it had spark and wit and humour too. I was bereft when I finished it (far too) late last night!’ Clare Swatman ‘Wow. Seriously. Just beautiful. So many wonderful elements... So many memorable characters... Beautiful and utterly affecting.’ Louise Beech ‘Charming, warm and moving...

Oh... what a beautiful story... Poignant and inspiring!’ Jennie Godfrey ‘Such a poignant story. Brought a lump to my throat...

It took me only two days to read this.  A simple, beautiful story, in which you just want to know what happens next. That was not the reason I got it; the reason was, I encountered an offer for a free book, one which seemed reasonably nice.  Despite my  backlog of 6 titles I urgently want to read, I plunged quickly into this one.  After all, one doesn't pass on a free book.  
  
Mabel, 86, lives lovingly with Arthur, until he dies, early in the book.  Heart failure, and he saw it coming.  Mabel didn't, but is, sort of, freed.  Aren't women always, when their men die?    
  
Anyway, nothing but good about Arthur.  And she was more the one blocking making their relationship of 62 years as loving as it could have been.  But, all good, and now Mabel's free.  
  
And this freedom, starting with boredom, develops into many friendships, with Julie, Erin, Patricia, Kirsty.  And Dot.  Loving relationships between all of them, each bearing some cross, some problem, some loss, some challenge, and by and by they open up to each other and jointly address their challenges.  And we get to know each of the characters, including Mabel, better and better.  As they start knowing each other better.  
  
Well, nothing but love and reconciliation in this book.  Mabel is charmingly fit and, of course, central to the book.  
  
And I just read it's a bestseller, because of the soft soap? but that's unfair, it's really a loving story.  I would not be surprised if the film rights have already been purchased.
