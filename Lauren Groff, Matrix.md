Finished it this morning, with a sigh of satisfaction.  Finally done!

Now, I'm not very much a religious person.  Not at all, in fact.  So had I known more of this book, I'd have passed.  Indeed, somewhere in the middle I thought, oh come on I get sick of this let's forget it, but then it felt so close to the finish, that I pressed on.

A good decision?  Hard to say.  At least some form of accomplishment.

Enough complaining. The book plays just before and after the year 1200, in England.  And the main character is Marie de France.  Surely a name to you well-educated – new to me before I got into this book.  Or is it about her?  Marie de France, the poet about whom almost nothing is known (and may not even have existed as such), but who is the authors of Lais of Marie de France; translated Aesop's fables, and wrote other works (I'm quoting wikipedia here).  And Marie, the abbess of a monastery, bringing it from extreme poverty to extreme richness in the 60 years that she reigns it.

The book brings life to the unknown person of Marie the France, with literary freedom impounding on history.  Marie, when she is banned to the convent by the queen,  Eleanor of Acquitaine.  Marie, bastard daughter of Eleanor's father's raping adventures.  A half-sister, therefore, but not respected.  Marie, at 17, banned to that convent where poverty and disease rules, brings things in order and is widely respected, feared, loved, hated, but never ignored.

And thus goes the book.  My take aways: I now know of Marie de France, but how this fits in with the whole Plantagenet stories – Shakespeareans beware – I don't fully appreciate.  It's a long time, after all, and these high middle ages were a bit, quite a bit, different from today, right?

Interesting fact: no men in this book.  Or almost none.  There are a few faceless, nameless, stonecutters.  And, the nuns being upset that the abbess, Marie, does the high mass, which is not supposed to be done by a woman.  But that's about it.  All good, all the same.

Again: the book is done, I can recommend it if you want to learn a bit, perhaps, about Marie de France, or at least by this Marie and her queen.  Otherwise, I cannot give an outright recommendation, and go against the stream and high acclaim of this recent novel.
