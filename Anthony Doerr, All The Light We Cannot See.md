description: Marie-Laure has been blind since the age of six. Her father builds a perfect miniature of their Paris neighbourhood so she can memorize it by touch and navigate her way home. But when the Nazis invade, father and daughter flee with a dangerous secret. Werner is a German orphan, destined to labour in the same mine that claimed his father's life, until he discovers a knack for engineering. His talent wins him a place at a brutal military academy, but his way out of obscurity is built on suffering. At the same time, far away in a walled city by the sea, an old man discovers new worlds without ever setting foot outside his home. But all around him, impending danger closes in. Doerr's combination of soaring imagination and meticulous observation is electric.

This book was on my list for a while, and I ignored it until recently. When I then wanted to buy it, I noticed that it was not only a crazy bestseller, but also (to be) made into a Netflix series or movie.  
  
Not the best of choices therefore, but still, my list was otherwise empty so there I went.  
  
The book deals of a girl, around 15, who lives in Paris with her father. She is blind, or goes blind, and her father – curator at the National History museum – takes care of here by, amongst other things, building a mockup of their neighbourhood, allowing Marie-Laure to mentally and then physically walk the streets without help.  
  
It's also about Werner, a German boy who is good with 1940's radios and other electronics circuits, and thus becomes an asset in the war effort.  
  
Spoiler: Marie-Laure and Werner will later meet, helping each other.  
  
Ladida, Marie-Laure flees Paris with her father, to Saint-Malo (Bretagne, at the sea), and they take refuge at an aunt and uncle who live there. And take _the diamond_, a huge stone called "The Sea of Flames". It is cursed, first recorded in India; and legend has it that it basically kills everyone except for its bearer or owner. Until it is returned to the sea. This part of the story is reminiscent of a real diamond, The Delhi Sapphire. A bit like [Wilkie Collins, The Moonstone](./Wilkie%20Collins,%20The%20Moonstone.md) in a way; are they related stories?  
  
Anyway.  Marie-Laure and her dad flee, as said. She slowly becomes accustomed to her surroundings; her dad rebuilds the new city for her (a mockup, I mean). She learns her new surroundings. And they have the diamond – without knowing it, since, as in an execution squad, four people were sent out with the diamond, of which three were excellent copies, and only one is real.  
  
In the meantime, a Nazi, Reinhold von Rumpel, is looking for the diamond. His task is to loot gems for the Reich (or himself), and is extremely successful.  
  
Well, things go on from there, and the book ends when Marie-Laure is an old woman. While all nazis, friendly and unfriendly, die.    
The book jumps between Marie-Laure and Werner; between 1940 and 1944; and sometimes other characters where it fits the story. Easy to translate in a never-ending series on Netflix, I'm sure. Each chapter is clearly marked, so one finds one's way through it easily.  And, I found the book an utter bore. And I was unable to feel sorry for the blind girl. Or the brilliant nazi boy. Or to be sad when her father died, or nearly so? Or to be moved in any direction. Cheap effects, it felt to me.  To me, how I imagine that war having been, and how this book describes it, are two different things.
