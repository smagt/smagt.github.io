About families in a run-down neighbourhood, is it souther America?  Or a slum in New York?  I forgot.  If you've seen Radio Days, you know the sort of neighbourhood I mean.  People living "on the street", everyone knows everyone.  The book is about a girl, or a few girls, coming to age.  It was recommended to me by a dear friend, and while it was OK, I would not recommend it on.
