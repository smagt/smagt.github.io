About families in a run-down neighbourhood, is it souther America?  Or a slum in New York?  I forgot.  If you've seen Radio Days, you know the sort of neighbourhood I mean.  People living "on the street", everyone knows everyone.  The book is about a girl, or a few girls, coming to age.  It was recommended to me by a dear friend, and while it was OK, I would not recommend it on.

About families in a run-down neighbourhood, in Chicago.  If you've seen Radio Days, you know the sort of neighbourhood I mean.  People living "on the street", everyone knows everyone.  The book is about a girl, or a few girls, coming to age.    
  
The story is narrated by Esperanza Cordero, a young Latina girl. Identity, culture, and community through Esperanza’s experiences and observations. Each vignette focuses on different aspects of her life, including her family, neighbours, and her thoughts about the future. Written in a straightforward style, each vignette contributes to a larger picture of Esperanza's coming of age and her desire to leave Mango Street; but she does not know where she belongs. A good portrayal of the Latinx experience in America.
