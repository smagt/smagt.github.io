description: "#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • PULITZER PRIZE WINNER • NATIONAL BOOK AWARD WINNER • &quot;An American masterpiece&quot; (NPR) that chronicles a young slave's adventures as she makes a desperate bid for freedom in the antebellum South. • The basis for the acclaimed original Amazon Prime Video series directed by Barry Jenkins. Cora is a slave on a cotton plantation in Georgia. An outcast even among her fellow Africans, she is on the cusp of womanhood—where greater pain awaits. And so when Caesar, a slave who has recently arrived from Virginia, urges her to join him on the Underground Railroad, she seizes the opportunity and escapes with him. In Colson Whitehead's ingenious conception, the Underground Railroad is no mere metaphor: engineers and conductors operate a secret network of actual tracks and tunnels beneath the Southern soil. Cora embarks on a harrowing flight from one state to the next, encountering, like Gulliver, strange yet familiar iterations of her own world at each stop. As Whitehead brilliantly re-creates the terrors of the antebellum era, he weaves in the saga of our nation, from the brutal abduction of Africans to the unfulfilled promises of the present day. The Underground Railroad is both the gripping tale of one woman's will to escape the horrors of bondage—and a powerful meditation on the history we all share. Look for Colson Whitehead’s new novel, Crook Manifesto, coming soon!"

Colson Whitehead won the Pulitzer Prize twice. Once for this book; once for [Colson Whitehead, The Nickel Boys](./Colson%20Whitehead,%20The%20Nickel%20Boys.md).  
  
This book describes the beginning of the end of slavery in the US, but before the Civil War.  It describes a black slave girl, and her incredible trail into freedom.  This trail is a system of people that collaborated to bring escaped slaves to the northern states; confusingly, Whitehead sometimes uses the term literally, and depicts trains driving underground, as if they were.  Took me a while to figure that one out!  
  
In the book Cora, a teenage slave girl who escapes from a Georgia plantation, travels to freedom via the Underground Railroad. The novel begins with Cora's grandmother, Ajarry, being kidnapped from Africa and brought to America as a slave. Ajarry dies after decades of working in the fields of the Randall plantation, leaving behind her daughter Mabel and granddaughter Cora. Cora's mother abandons her, and Cora is mistreated by the other slaves on the plantation. She eventually escapes with another slave named Caesar, and they make their way to the Underground Railroad.  
  
The railroad is described as an actual railroad with stations below farms and houses. The first train takes Cora and Caesar to South Carolina, where they are able to live more like free people. However, their newfound freedom is short-lived, as they soon discover that the hospital they thought was helping them with free medical care is actually conducting government experiments to kill off and sterilise black people. They also learn that the slave catcher Ridgeway is in pursuit of them.  
  
Cora's next stop is North Carolina, where the situation for black people, free or fugitive, is much worse. Cora is taken in by the reluctant station agent Martin Wells and his wife Edith, who is very upset by Cora's presence. Cora lives in a small hiding space in the Wells' attic, where she sees a horrible spectacle take place every Friday night on the town square. North Carolina has worked to expel or kill all black people in the state, and Friday Festivals are a weekly display of racist propaganda ending with the hanging of a black person, a grisly act in which the whole town participates.  
  
As time goes by, Cora improves her reading in the attic room, but there is no way out for her. Finally, Cora falls ill and has to be cared for in the Wells' home. The novel ends with Cora's journey coming full circle, as she returns to the plantation where she was born and confronts her past.
