description: "'She's like no one I've ever met... She's like fire and water all at once.' Warwickshire, 1582. Agnes Hathaway, a natural healer, meets the Latin tutor, William Shakespeare. Drawn together by powerful but hidden impulses, they create a life together and make a family. As William moves to London to discover his place in the world of theatre, Agnes stays at home to raise their three children but she is the constant presence and purpose of his life. When the plague steals 11-year-old Hamnet from his loving parents, they must each confront their loss alone. And yet, out of the greatest suffering, something of extraordinary wonder is born. This new play based on Maggie O'Farrell's best-selling novel and adapted by award-winning playwright Lolita Chakrabarti (Life of Pi, Red Velvet, Hymn), pulls back a curtain on the imagined family life of the greatest writer in the English language. Hamnet is a love letter to passion, birth, grief and the magic of nature. This edition was published to coincide with the world premiere at the Swan Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, in April, 2023."

This book is about Anne Hathaway, Shakespeare's wife.  Now the thing I know about Shakespeare is that so little is known about him, that there are even those who think he never really existed.  But this book made me understand that as a bit of an exaggeration.  Surely, it is much romanticised, but apparently Anne and William were married, and had three children, the twins Hamnet and a girl, and an older girl.  Anne seems to be a wonderful woman, the marriage is intermittent though, and challenged as life does.  While reading this, I liked to understand this as Shakespeare's (wife) real life, how it really could have been.  William is not a nice chap, but not too bad either.  Just your regular guy who lives for his theatre.  I buy that.  Lovely book.
