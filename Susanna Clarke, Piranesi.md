description: "Winner of the 2021 Women's Prize for Fiction A SUNDAY TIMES & NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER The spectacular new novel from the bestselling author of JONATHAN STRANGE & MR NORRELL, 'one of our greatest living authors' NEW YORK MAGAZINE __________________________________ Piranesi lives in the House. Perhaps he always has. In his notebooks, day after day, he makes a clear and careful record of its wonders: the labyrinth of halls, the thousands upon thousands of statues, the tides that thunder up staircases, the clouds that move in slow procession through the upper halls. On Tuesdays and Fridays Piranesi sees his friend, the Other. At other times he brings tributes of food to the Dead. But mostly, he is alone. Messages begin to appear, scratched out in chalk on the pavements. There is someone new in the House. But who are they and what do they want? Are they a friend or do they bring destruction and madness as the Other claims? Lost texts must be found; secrets must be uncovered. The world that Piranesi thought he knew is becoming strange and dangerous. The Beauty of the House is immeasurable; its Kindness infinite. __________________________________ 'What a world Susanna Clarke conjures into being ...

Piranesi is a magick book.  And when I say that, you will be mislead.  Hence the additional "k", to clarify that I did not mean "magic".    
  
Got it?  Nor do I.    
  
Piranesi is the main character, the narrator of the story.  He's caught in a space where, a world consisting of chambers, rooms, with the sea below and the sky above.  Each room, each hall is decorated with statues, and of course there are animals everywhere: birds, sea creatures,...  Piranesi lives there, heating with seaweed, eating fish, loving life.    
  
And there's someone else, "The Other", whom he meets twice a week.    
  
From the beginning to the end of this magickal book, it's not clear if this world Piranesi lives in is real, or if it is just his dream.  And maybe it is not relevant: he's happy, discovering his vast world over the course of years.    
  
Things change, of course, he discovers others, and the story unravels from there.    
  
Piranesi's character is not developing too much.  To me he appeared quite naive, probably thus put in my head on purpose by the author.  And I think that that works well; at the same time, the Other, though hardly ever present, becomes increasingly multidimensional.    
  
Not a dull moment when reading this book; exciting from the first page.  A highly recommended read, methinks.  It caused me to read the other book by Clarke.
