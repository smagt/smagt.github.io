description: A story of queer love and working-class families, Young Mungo is the brilliant second novel from the Booker Prize-winning author of Shuggie Bain Acclaimed as one of the best books of the year by NPR, Kirkus Reviews, Time, and Amazon, and named a Top 10 Book of the Year by the Washington Post, Young Mungo is a brilliantly constructed and deeply moving story of queer love and working-class families by the Booker Prize-winning author of Shuggie Bain. Growing up in a housing estate in Glasgow, Mungo and James are born under different stars--Mungo a Protestant and James a Catholic--and they should be sworn enemies. Yet against all odds, they fall in love as they find sanctuary and dream of escape in the pigeon dovecote that James has built for his prize racing birds. But when Mungo's mother sends him on a fishing trip to a remote loch with two strange men, he will need all his strength and courage to find his way back to a place where he and James might still have a future.

After having read [Shuggy Bain](./Douglas%20Stuart,%20Shuggie%20Bain.md), a year or two ago, I was fearful starting this one.  Again a drunk mother, 3 kids, one of whom drifts off in violence, one who tries to keep the bunch together, and one who drifts off – previously Shuggy, here Mungo.  So, what else could be new in yet another novel about Glasgow in the Thatcher era?  
  
Well, everything.  Forget the previous book, this is the same yet totally different.  Mungo grows up towards a homosexual relationship, and is abused by just about everyone because of it.  
  
So, Mungo is like 14 or so, and lives with his sister and mum.  Mum is a drunk, and disappears early to live with her boyfriend, not informing the kids.  They cope, later meet her by chance and confront her.  Mungo falls in love with a boy a few streets away, and his soft behaviour is noticed by his mother and abusive brother.  They send him on a trip to a Loch with two child-abusive ex convicts – it doesn't go well, of course.  Nor does his love.    
  
Young Mungo is a sad book, playing in a Britain that I've seen parts of, and can perhaps understand a bit.  It puts the being trapped in poverty, despair, hopelessness in such a clear, central position that one does not love the characters, but at least feels with them, or understands their desperate decisions.  Whether it is the violence that Mungo sometimes needs to revert to; whether his brother who saves him in the end – family over all? – whether his mother who decides to forget her children to pursue her own life.
