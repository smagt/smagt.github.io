description: "A many-faceted exploration of spoken eloquence: how it works, how it has evolved, and how to tap its remarkable power We all know eloquence when we hear it. But what exactly is it? And how might we gain more of it for ourselves? This entertaining and, yes, eloquent book illuminates the power of language from a linguistic point of view and provides fascinating insights into the way we use words. David Crystal, a world-renowned expert on the history and usage of the English language, probes the intricate workings of eloquence. His lively analysis encompasses everyday situations (wedding speeches, business presentations, storytelling) as well as the oratory of great public gatherings. Crystal focuses on the here and now of eloquent speaking--from pitch, pace, and prosody to jokes, appropriateness, and how to wield a microphone. He explains what is going on moment by moment and examines each facet of eloquence. He also investigates topics such as the way current technologies help or hinder our verbal powers, the psychological effects of verbal excellence, and why certain places or peoples are thought to be more eloquent than others. In the core analysis of the book, Crystal offers an extended and close dissection of Barack Obama's electrifying &quot;Yes we can&quot; speech of 2008, in which the president demonstrated full mastery of virtually every element of eloquence--from the simple use of parallelism and an awareness of what not to say, to his brilliant conclusion constructed around two powerful words: dreams and answers."

In a craze of loving language and its analysis, I randomly picked up a number of David Crystal books.  In _The Gift of the Gab: How Eloquence Works_ I found a book that explores the power of language from a linguistic point of view and, as in any of Crystal's books, shows how we (should) use words.  
  
Crystal examines different aspects of eloquence, including rhythm, tone, and body language. He provides examples from famous speeches, literature, and everyday conversations to show how these elements come together to create powerful speech. Central is Barack Obama’s “Yes we can” speech of 2008, and shows how near-perfect that speech was – from the simple use of parallelism and an awareness of what not to say, to his brilliant conclusion constructed around dreams and answers.  
  
Learn here how to structure a good speech to telling stories and engaging an audience. Crystal also looks at the history of rhetoric and how the principles of eloquence have been applied over time.  
  
Crystal's conversational style works here, too, and mingling theory with real-world examples makes this book, too, never tedious or boring.  
  
Read it if you want to improve your speaking skills – or criticise that of others, for that matter – or just to understand what makes effective communication.
