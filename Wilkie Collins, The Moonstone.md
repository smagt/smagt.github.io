_Dear Vicky, I apologise for reading this decades after you suggested I should._

Since "The legend of sleepy hollow", roundabout New York, I started reading "The moonstone" by Wilkie Collins.  It'd been on my todo list since I was 20, an English very dear friend suggested I read it, and though I'd gobbled up all her other recommendations, this one remained unread for decades.  Turns out it's the first whodunnit, from the late 1800s, and perhaps not the easiest reads, also not a difficult book.  About a diamond which ends up from India in Britain, when it shouldn't, and a good bunch of people dying in its course.  Lovely, with beautiful characters and a story which kept me in suspense till the end.
