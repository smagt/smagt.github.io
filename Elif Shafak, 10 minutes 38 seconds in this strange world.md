description: "SHORTLISTED FOR THE BOOKER PRIZE 2019 'Expect vibrant, vivid and eye-opening descriptions of Middle Eastern life propelled by a tender storyline, all in Shafak's haunting, beautiful and considered prose' Vanity Fair 'Incredibly sensuous and poetic and evocative' Pandora Sykes 'Richly uplifting... truly beautiful writing' Nicola Sturgeon 'In the first minute following her death, Tequila Leila's consciousness began to ebb, slowly and steadily, like a tide receding from the shore...' For Leila, each minute after her death recalls a sensuous memory: spiced goat stew, sacrificed by her father to celebrate the birth of a yearned-for son; bubbling vats of lemon and sugar to wax women's legs while men are at prayer; the cardamom coffee she shares with a handsome student in the brothel where she works. Each fading memory brings back the friends she made in her bittersweet life - friends who are now desperately trying to find her . . . 'Simply magnificent, a truly captivating work of immense power and beauty, on the essence of life and its end' Philippe Sands 'Elif Shafak brings into the written realm what so many others want to leave outside. Spend more than ten minutes and 38 seconds in this world of the estranged. Shafak makes a new home for us in words' Colum McCann 'Elif Shafak's extraordinary 10 Minutes, 38 Seconds in this Strange World is a work of brutal beauty and consummate tenderness' Simon Schama 'A rich, sensual novel... This is a novel that gives voice to the invisible, the untouchable, the abused and the damaged, weaving their painful songs into a thing of beauty.' Financial Times 'One of the best writers in the world today' Hanif Kureishi 'Haunting, moving, beautifully written. A masterpiece' Peter Frankopan 'Extraordinary' Guardian 'Life-affirming' Stylist *Elif Shafak's latest novel The Island of Missing Trees is available now*"

Tequila Leila, an Istanbul whore, has been murdered, and left in a dumpster. Her heart stopped beating, but her brain is still active, highly alert for... 10 minutes and 38 seconds.  
  
This book gives you that brain, in that period of time.  
  
The book has three parts. The first part, "The Mind," covers Leila's life in Istanbul, from her childhood to her years as a sex worker. Each minute after her death brings back a memory.  
  
The second part, "The Body," focuses on Leila's five close friends. They learn about her death and come together to honour her memory.  
  
The final part, "The Soul," follows the friends as they try to give Leila a proper burial.  
  
Central in the book is Istanbul, its beauty and its darker sides.  
  
Beautifully written, for which it was Booker Prize shortlisted.  A wonderful, simple, enjoyable language, and one learns about Turkey at the same time, but mostly about solitude, and friends, parents, and such.  I can recommend this to anyone.  But, in the end, the book ends too happily, too sweet for me.  Well, not counting that she's dead, of course.
