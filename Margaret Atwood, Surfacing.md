An earlier Atwood novel, describing how a young woman travels back to her disappeared dad's cottage, somewhere at a Canadian lake.

You can feel the mosquitos.  

She visits his cottage with three friends; her boyfriend, and a married couple.  They are all in their late twenties. With a lot of sexual tension between the three, and not all of it healthy and pleasant. Yet the main character, who remains unnamed, remains on top of the whole situation.

She is fighting for her freedom: free from her father's legacy; from her boyfriend; from society.  And wins, in a certain way.  Her strength is unparalleled, her determinedness unwavering.  And goes "over dead bodies", so to speak.  

A person to admire.  And no less, the author.
