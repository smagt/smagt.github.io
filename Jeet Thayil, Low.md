description: Ullis went to the bathroom and carefully unfolded the business card and placed it on the sink. Then he rolled up a note and snorted the last of his wife's ashes.Following the death of his wife, Dominic Ullis escapes to Bombay in search of oblivion and a dangerous new drug, Meow Meow. So begins a glorious weekend of misadventure as he tours the teeming, kaleidoscopic city from its sleek eyries of high-capital to the piss-stained streets, encountering a cast with their own stories to tell, but none of whom Ullis - his faculties ever distorted - is quite sure he can trust.Heady, heartbroken and heartfelt, Low is a blazing joyride through the darklands of grief towards obliteration - and, perhaps, epiphany.'Jeet Thayil delights not just in pushing the bounds of possibility, but in smashing them to smithereens.' John Burnside

Low by Jeet Thayil. Also shortlisted somewhere.  About a mid-30s? indian couple, who'd lived in the US for years, and now repatriating to Bangalore.  Except that she's deceased, and he carries her ashes around.  He copes with her apparent suicide through alcohol and drugs, in an almost continuous stupor, stumbling from one place to the next.    
  
Impossible for me to relate to, I ploughed until halfish the book, then decided, enough is enough.  Then I'd rather reread Zen and the art of Motorcycle Maintenance, or even Joseph Heller's Catch 22 (the book of his which I disliked most, while having read almost all of Heller's books).
