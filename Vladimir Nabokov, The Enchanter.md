description: The Enchanter is the Ur-Lolita, the precursor to Nabokov's classic novel. At once hilarious and chilling, it tells the story of an outwardly respectable man and his fatal obsession with certain pubescent girls, whose coltish grace and subconscious coquetry reveal, to his mind, a special bud on the verge of bloom.

I've always been an avid Nabokov reader. Discovering him when I was a young adult, I read many a book of him and enjoying many of them. Nabokov has very beautiful language use. His refreshing use of adjectives, as if talking with bouquets of flowers, makes things so vivid. At the same time, he is very approachable and not as lengthy as, say, Flaubert.    
  
Stubborn as I was, I ready many but on purpose stayed away from Lolita. That I changed recently, maybe 5 years ago or so. And I understood, or appreciated, it's his most-celebrated novel. I loved that book, for many a reason, and perhaps the most surprising part was that I did not condemn Humbert. The author almost let me understand his crimes.Â     
  
The Enchanter is a prequel of Lolita. An attempt of Nabokov to write on this topic; with a totally different, dissatisfying ending; nonetheless a beautifully written book.
