I've always been an avid Nabokov reader. Discovering him when I was a young adult, I read many a book of him and enjoying many of them. Nabokov has very beautiful language use. His refreshing use of adjectives, as if talking with bouquets of flowers, makes things so vivid. At the same time, he is very approachable and not as lengthy as, say, Flaubert.    
  
Stubborn as I was, I ready many but on purpose stayed away from Lolita. That I changed recently, maybe 5 years ago or so. And I understood, or appreciated, it's his most-celebrated novel. I loved that book, for many a reason, and perhaps the most surprising part was that I did not condemn Humbert. The author almost let me understand his crimes.Â     
  
The Enchanter is a prequel of Lolita. An attempt of Nabokov to write on this topic; with a totally different, dissatisfying ending; nonetheless a beautifully written book.

"The Enchanter" by Vladimir Nabokov is a novella written in Russian in 1939 but published posthumously in 1986. It is often considered a precursor to Nabokov's more famous novel [Lolita](./Vladimir%20Nabokov,%20Lolita.md).  
  
The story revolves around an unnamed, middle-aged man who becomes obsessively predating on a twelve-year-old girl. Driven by his uncontrollable desires, he marries the girl's ailing mother to gain access to her. After the mother dies, he takes the girl on a trip, intending to act on his fantasies.   
  
So far so similar to Lolita.  But then the book is more aligned with moral standards. After taking the girl on a trip, he finds himself unable to go through with his intentions due to a combination of guilt and the girl's innocence. His inner torment and moral conflict reach a peak. When the girl finally falls asleep in a hotel room, he attempts to act on his desires but is overwhelmed by his conscience. In a state of despair and self-loathing, he rushes out of the room, into the street, and is ultimately struck by a truck, ending his life. The book ends with a sense of tragic inevitability and moral reckoning, highlighting the destructive nature of desire. The story ends with the girl's future left ambiguous, highlighting the devastating consequences of the man's obsession and the destructive nature of desire.
