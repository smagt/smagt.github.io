description: Britain's answer to Donna Tartt' Sunday Times 'A huge talent' Hilary Mantel 'Was this how it was going to be for ever? Wrapping things for customers in womenswear, no conversation. Polishing the counters so her face reflected in the brass and sweeping floors at closing time until the boss said she could leave. How much worse off would she be if she went driving with a stranger for a while?' When sixteen-year-old Joyce Savigear absconds from work to go out with a man she barely knows, she hopes a new, exciting life is just beginning. But, two years later, she is waiting on a railway station in the tranquil English countryside. It's the summer of 1952 and she and her younger brother Charlie have just been released from borstal. Another fresh start awaits - but can Joyce ever outrun the darkness of her past? 'What a writer' Richard Osman 'An involving tale of revenge and responsibility, which, while it devastates, also tells us that new lives can be built among the ashes' FT 'The Young Accomplice shows the difference between a book that slides down the surface of things, and one that digs its claws into you and sticks there' The Times

I actually liked this story a lot.  Two youths leave a juvenile detention centre to work for architects; we are talking 1950's here in the shadow of the great Frank Lloyd Wright.  (Again I felt at ease, having visited homes of his in Chicago, and around Cape Cod.)  They are siblings, and she's a bit of a rotten apple, haven slid into that position by a criminal abusing her.  Anyway, they are given this chance to build up their lives with this young architect couple who want to make a farm / architecture office while helping and being helped with young delinquents.      
  
The title refers to both situations, I'm sure.  She's an accomplice for this crook, and both are accomplices to the architects. A compelling story with historical value.  A very quick, gripping read.
