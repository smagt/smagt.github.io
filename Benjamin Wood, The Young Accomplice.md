I actually liked this story a lot.  Two youths leave a juvenile detention centre to work for architects; we are talking 1950's here in the shadow of the great Frank Lloyd Wright.  (Again I felt at ease, having visited homes of his in Chicago, and around cape cod.)  They are siblings, and she's a bit of a rotten apple, haven slid into that position by a criminal abusing her.  Anyway, they are given this chance to build up their lives with this young architect couple who want to make a farm / architecture office while helping and being helped with young delinquents.      
  
The title refers to both situations, I'm sure.  She's an accomplice for this crook, and both are accomplices to the architects. A compelling story with some historical value, I believe.  A very quick, gripping read.  Not worth rereading for me, but worth having read.
