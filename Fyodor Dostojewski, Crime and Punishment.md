You may know that the book is about a student in Petersburg who decides to kill someone, and that happens to lead to two killings. But that is only the entourage of the story: I won't spoil it for you. That's anyway not so important, but it is in line with the reason for the murders. He is a literature, philosophy, politics student, and wants to prove a point about right and wrong, about good and bad. How bad is not always bad, and some people are "above the law", almost. The current war is a good point in case, actually. Good and bad is relative, depending on who you are.    
  
I am tempted to say, the book is very Russian; shows a lot about Russian culture (back then). Who am I to judge, of course, having only been in Petersburg for a few days and not knowing the country at all! Then again, of course, by definition the book is that.    
  
I enjoyed reading it, or more, I enjoyed having read it. Sometimes a bit too despondent; the women a bit too literary, too similar: self-sacrifice, suffering, yet strong. Very gender-structured. Not bad, but also a bit dimensionless. (Am I allowed to criticise such an author? Probably no.) Of course, the main protagonist of the novel, Raskolnikov, also demonstrates well that life is not a picnic.    
Interestingly, the recent book "The sinner and the saint: Dostoyevsky, a crime and its punishment" by Kevin Birmingham goes deeper into the background of the novel and it's on my todo list. Later, therefore.
