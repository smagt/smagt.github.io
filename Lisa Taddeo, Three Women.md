Lina, a young mother in suburban Indiana whose marriage has lost its passion, reconnects with an old flame through social media and embarks on an affair that quickly becomes all-consuming. Maggie, a seventeen-year-old high school student in North Dakota, allegedly engages in a relationship with her married English teacher; the ensuing criminal trial turns their quiet community upside down. Sloane, a successful restaurant owner in an exclusive enclave of the Northeast, is happily married to a man who likes to watch her have sex with other men and women. Hailed as “a dazzling achievement” (Los Angeles Times) and “a riveting page-turner that explores desire, heartbreak, and infatuation in all its messy, complicated nuance” (The Washington Post), Lisa Taddeo’s Three Women has captivated readers, booksellers, and critics—and topped bestseller lists—worldwide. Based on eight years of immersive research, it is “an astonishing work of literary reportage” (The Atlantic) that introduces us to three unforgettable women—and one remarkable writer—whose experiences remind us that we are not alone."

I love Taddeo's work, and I bough this book immediately after starting in her "Animal". Three Women is her first work, and it's not a novel, but something like a true story; or at least based on real women. It's the stories of three women, centred on their sexual lives, or rather, how sex plays a central role in their lives. With pain, love, rape, passion, and hate. The three stories are totally separate, except that they are intertwined chapter-wise, and that there are parallels in their developments, in their experiences, in their disappointments, in their pains. And yes, it is not all pretty there, and yes, uncouth male behaviour is a common streak.     
  
I sometimes I have the feeling that I've seen it all. Nothing is less true, of course, and I was happy to read this since it made me understand more and see a bit clearer though good old hetero relationships. Not sure if I do, but at least I have a bit more of colour in the palette now.   
  
Highly recommended read from me. Probably even more than "Animal".
