This is the first book by the author of "Piranesi" which I read recently.  My liking that book made me decide, ok, I'll take this one, too, even though it's about 800 pages long.  Sigh, what a task.  

But no complaint; Clarke needed 10 years to write it.  You may know the title as a BBC miniseries.  I did not, and I doubt I'll ever watch it (even though it, as the book, won prizes).  I don't like a film of a book I know, mostly.  

Long story short: it's a book written as "alternative history" of Britain, or England, in the early 1800s, where magic is revived, it having died out about 400 years before.  

Based on Mr. Norrell, who during his lifetime collected all serious books on magic, and used them to study and practice it himself.  Successfully.  

But he is not a likeable character, and thus is surpassed by his pupil, Jonathan Strange.  Despite having access to only a few of the ancient books on magic, Jonathan becomes a powerful magician, on par with Norrell, and helps the country in its struggles and fights.  

Still, all is not as strong as the Raven King aka John Uskglass, who lived from about 1100.  He was king of northern England, and the elves kingdom, and some more.  Disappeared around 1400, 1500.  But, of course, being the most powerful magician every around, is still there, somewhere.  

Also in the book, and the power struggle between Uskglass, Strange, and Norrell is a predominant theme of the book.  

I cannot make it more attractive than this.  Yes, I liked it.  Yes, I was impressed and it will not be a book I will quickly forget.  I even read all the footnotes of each chapter, mostly with literature references, but also often with background historical notes.  But why did it impress me?  Perhaps because it's a work that took 10 years to complete?  And a first novel of an author where the publishers paid 1M advance?  Such oddities the internet reveals, and I found out only afterwards.  

Never during the read I started to dream that it's a sort-of-factual story.  It's not written that way, as it describes the daily conversations of the main characters; it is too personal (w.r.t. these persons) a story.  Also because of that it is gripping, one can live with the characters, almost.   

Highly recommended.  Beautiful is the use of language; Clarke goes back not just to 19th-century spelling (controul, scissars, chuses, shew, to name a few) but also to a writing style which we know rather from Jane Austin than anything one would write today.  That is at least as entertaining as Austin herself.
