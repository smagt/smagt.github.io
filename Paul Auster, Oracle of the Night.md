description: Several months into his recovery from a near-fatal illness, thirty-four-year-old novelist Sidney Orr enters a stationery shop in the Cobble Hill section of Brooklyn and buys a blue notebook. It is September 18, 1982, and for the next nine days Orr will live under the spell of this blank book, trapped inside a world of eerie premonitions and puzzling events that threaten to destroy his marriage and undermine his faith in reality. Why does his wife suddenly break down in tears in the backseat of a taxi just hours after Sidney begins writing in the notebook? Why does M. R. Chang, the owner of the stationery shop, precipitously close his business the next day? What are the connections between a 1938 Warsaw telephone directory and a lost novel in which the hero can predict the future? At what point does animosity explode into violence? To what degree is forgiveness the ultimate expression of love? Paul Auster's mesmerizing eleventh novel reads like an old-fashioned ghost story. But there are no ghosts in this book—only flesh-and-blood human beings, wandering through the haunted realms of everyday life. At once a meditation on the nature of time and a journey through the labyrinth of one man's imagination, Oracle Night is a narrative tour de force that confirms Auster's reputation as one of the boldest, most original writers at work in America today.

The novel begins with Sidney Orr, a writer recovering from a severe illness that has left him physically and creatively drained. As he attempts to regain his strength, he visits a small, mysterious stationary shop in Brooklyn, where he purchases a blue notebook that inexplicably draws him in. Upon returning home, Orr begins writing in the notebook, and soon finds himself immersed in a new story.  
  
In the story Orr writes, a literary editor named Nick Bowen receives a manuscript that compels him to abandon his life and embark on a strange journey. As Orr writes, the boundaries between his fiction and his reality begin to blur. Events in Orr’s life start to mirror the narrative he is creating in the blue notebook, leading to unexpected and sometimes troubling consequences.  
  
Meanwhile, Orr’s personal life is complicated by his relationships with his wife, Grace, and his close friend, John Trause, an older writer who plays a significant role in Orr’s life. Tensions arise as secrets and past events come to light, affecting Orr’s marriage and his friendship with Trause.  
  
The narrative shifts between multiple storylines – the life of Sidney Orr, the fictional tale of Nick Bowen, and the lives of other characters connected to Orr.  These stories reach their resolutions, with Orr gaining a deeper understanding of the mysterious forces at play in his life and the potential power of his creative work. In the end Orr reflects on the impact of the blue notebook and how reality and fiction relate.  
  
Well... many things happen, many characters pass, and many loose ends ensue.  The final mystery of the blue notebook remains sadly unsolved. And while the story is entertaining, as Auster' stories are, there is a sense of incompleteness and unfinished business in the end.  
  
Still: Auster, you know.
