description: WINNER OF THE 2022 NOBEL PRIZE IN LITERATURE The diary of one of France’s most important, award-winning writers during the year she had a passionate and secret love affair with a Russian diplomat Getting Lost is the diary Annie Ernaux kept during the year and a half she had a secret love affair with a younger, married man, a Russian diplomat. Her novel, Simple Passion, was based on this affair, but here her writing is immediate, unfiltered. In these diaries it is 1989 and Annie is divorced with two grown sons, living outside of Paris and nearing fifty. Her lover escapes the city to see her there and Ernaux seems to survive only in expectation of these encounters, saying “his desire for me is the only thing I can be sure of.” She cannot write, she trudges distractedly through her various other commitments in the world, she awaits his next call; she lives only to feel desire and for the next rendezvous. When he is gone and the desire has faded, she feels that she is a step closer to death. Lauded for her spare prose, Ernaux here removes all artifice, her writing pared down to its most naked and vulnerable. Getting Lost is as strong a book as any that she has written, a haunting, desperate view of strong and successful woman who seduces a man only to lose herself in love and desire.

Ernaux having won the recent Nobel prize, of course her work needs to be read.  And this, I was then surprised to read, is one of her longer works; Ernaux is known for her shorter stories.  
Caveat: I read an English translation.  I apologise for that laziness.  
The book is partly autobiographic, and follows her decades old description of her affair with a Soviet diplomat, back then.  "Naturally, I will not go to the L’Événement du jeudi cocktail party tomorrow because he could call while I’m out…" says it all, I think; how she is crazily dependent on this man.  Until the fall of the USSR.  "Having spoken to him is worse than silence. I realize just how much time there is to fill before I can be with him again. My life is hollowed out by desire and pain."  
  
Their relationship is, almost entirely, carnal: "I’ve already forgotten his gestures, and all I want to do is sleep, in tears, because S does not call. 11.45 p.m. He came and stayed five hours. It had been a long time since I’d experienced such perfection, and since we’d been so attuned to each other. Made love, four times, in different ways. (Bedroom, anal sex after many long and slow caresses – downstairs sofa, missionary very tender too – bedroom, so moving: ‘I’m going to put my sperm on your belly’ – the sofa, doggy style, so perfectly in tune.) An infinite need for the other’s body, his presence."   Or, "For the first time, I want to keep a g-string soaked with his sperm under my pillow."

But, not a pornographic book at all.  It's really about her despair, her inability to write a book for the years that she "suffers" the relationship, that she needs to wait until he calls her again, waiting empty hours in her dependence.  
  
Ernaux is lost in love.  Don't let this happen to you.  But probably you know the feeling.  I know I do, and, somehow, this was an eye opener for me, on dependence, on how-can-she-be-like-that and then realising one's own having been there, having seen it.
