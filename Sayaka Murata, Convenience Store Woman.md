*Convenience store woman* by Sayaka Murata made me immediately fall in love with the author's work.  Magic realism at its purest!  This is about an employee of a 7-11, the convenience store you'll find everywhere in Japan and which is your go-to place there if you   
- need a quick bite, or   
- need cash, or   
- need a toilet, or,   
- are bored, or   
- want to see Japanese life;   
or any of such daily needs in that beautiful country.  Usually open 24/7, and often located at train stations.    
  
So the main character in this book works there, and that's her life.  Nothing more, nothing less.  The book describes how she tries to appear normal while filling her life with this job; even goes so far as to arrange a marriage to appear normal.  If 7-11 is Japan, then this book is even more Japan.    
  
Love it.
