description: The greatest literary landmark of antiquity masterfully rendered by the most celebrated translator of our time. When Emily Wilson’s translation of The Odyssey appeared in 2017—revealing the ancient poem in a contemporary idiom that was “fresh, unpretentious and lean” (Madeline Miller, Washington Post)—critics lauded it as “a revelation” (Susan Chira, New York Times) and “a cultural landmark” (Charlotte Higgins, Guardian) that would forever change how Homer is read in English. Now Wilson has returned with an equally revelatory translation of Homer’s other great epic—the most revered war poem of all time. The Iliad roars with the clamor of arms, the bellowing boasts of victors, the fury and grief of loss, and the anguished cries of dying men. It sings, too, of the sublime magnitude of the world—the fierce beauty of nature and the gods’ grand schemes beyond the ken of mortals. In Wilson’s hands, this thrilling, magical, and often horrifying tale now gallops at a pace befitting its legendary battle scenes, in crisp but resonant language that evokes the poem’s deep pathos and reveals palpably real, even “complicated,” characters—both human and divine. The culmination of a decade of intense engagement with antiquity’s most surpassingly beautiful and emotionally complex poetry, Wilson’s Iliad now gives us a complete Homer for our generation.

Sometimes I'm cheap. I waited several months for the price of this book to go down to a level which I considered reasonable. After all, the decrease in price does not affect the author; it affects the seller.  
  
I'd prefer to nick the book and then transfer 20 directly to the author. But I understand that approach does not scale. So anyway, having had enough other stuff to read, I sat this one out and recently bought it.  
  
Why? Because I read the other translation by Emily Wilson, of [The Odyssey](./Homer,%20The%20Odyssey.md) and was flabbergasted. How can a near-3,000 year old book be as good, as contemporary, as normal as this?  
  
Anyway, wrong side up, reading first the Odyssey, then the Iliad. But knowing both stories reasonably well, of course -- who doesn't, and on top of that I had read the series by Pat Barker: [The Silence of the Girls](./Pat%20Barker,%20The%20Silence%20of%20the%20Girls.md); [The Women of Troy](./Pat%20Barker,%20The%20Women%20of%20Troy.md); [The Voyage Home](./Pat%20Barker,%20The%20Voyage%20Home.md) so knew many details that Homer wasn't even aware of -- I felt well-versed to go ahead and read them in any order. I regret not that choice.
