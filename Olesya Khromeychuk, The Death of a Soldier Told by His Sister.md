description: "A moving and thought-provoking story of loss and war *** 'Elegantly written... packed with the sharpness of moments when a death suddenly becomes real' -TLS 'If you want to understand Ukraine's determination to resist, Olesya Khromeychuk's book is essential.' -Paul Mason, author of How to Stop Fascism 'A touching and brilliantly written account about grief, and also about strength. I read it in one night.' -Olia Hercules 'If you read only one book about the war, this is the one to read.' -Henry Marsh, author of Do No Harm [A] tender and courageous book... Khromeychuk's clear-sighted prose expresses the pain that thousands, even millions, have felt, not just in Ukraine now but in every conflict, past and present. -The Literary Review Magazine WITH A FOREWORD BY PHILIPPE SANDS AND AN INTRODUCTION BY ANDREY KURKOV Killed by shrapnel as he served in the Ukrainian Armed Forces, Olesya Khromeychuk's brother Volodymyr died on the frontline in eastern Ukraine. As Olesya tries to come to terms with losing her brother, she also tries to process the Russian invasion of Ukraine: as an immigrant living far from the frontline, as a historian of war and how societies respond to them, and as a woman, a civilian, and a sister. In this timely blend of memoir and essay, Olesya Khromeychuk tells the story of her brother - the wiser older sibling, the artist and the soldier - and of his death. Deeply moving and thoughtful, The Death of a Soldier Told by His Sister picks apart the ways political violence shapes everyone and everything it touches and depicts with extraordinary intimacy the singular and complicated bond between a brother and sister. Olesya's vivid writing is a personal and powerful commitment to honesty in life, in death and in memory. 'Soon before he died, my brother said he had become a warrior. Why would a thinker, an artist, wish to become a soldier? Perhaps I didn't appreciate what it meant to be a thinker and an artist, or, maybe, what it meant to be a soldier.' 'In vivid, intimate prose and with unflinching honesty, Olesya Khromeychuk introduces us to the brother she lost in the war and found in her grief.' -Dr Rory Finnin, University of Cambridge 'I admire a book that invites me to grapple with knotty questions. Olesya Khromeychuk has written such a book - beautifully.' - Professor Cynthia Enloe, author of Nimo's War 'Moving, intelligent, and brilliantly written.' -Anna Reid, author of Borderland: A Journey Through the History of Ukraine"

A book that should not have been.  And still, it was.  I'm in the great situation of being able to observe the senselessness of war, from a large, safe distance.  And despite all the false rationalism, it baffles that, indeed, war exists.  
  
And still, looking at history, war settles things. At least, sometimes. WW1 for instance.  It ended the Austrian-Hungarian empire.  It ended the Russian empire, started the Soviet Union.  It ended the Ottoman empire.  It ended the German empire, tens of countries were created or reinstated, the impact of the misnamed "Spanish flu" was probably a result of the war, and then, of course, Japan gained strength to continue their war against China, and Hitler exploited weaknesses of the Weimar republic – e.g., the regulation that it could not have an army, and thus not fight against Hitler – to create a coup; he succeeded the second time he tried.  
  
But back to this book. Despite the huge consequences wars can have, this war feels utterly useless, and built on the ego of a single individual. That oversimplifies things, and questions close to this, about the senselessness of war, and of why people choose to fight, govern this book. But then, as you already know, written by the sister of a fallen soldier.  
  
_The list of army supplies I bought for my brother to help him with his life in the warzone was still lying on my desk when a new shopping list appeared next to it. This made my online order inventories pretty eclectic:   
tartan paper napkins (3 packs of 20)   
emergency burn care dressing (pack of 5)  
yellow/blue satin ribbon (5 metres)   
Tasmanian tiger khaki backpack (1)   
table confetti (20 packs)   
advanced blood clotting sponge (25g x 2)   
favours for wedding guests (miniature whiskey bottles x 50)   
  
_If anyone saw this list, they would think I was either having a war-themed wedding or that I was getting married in the trenches. This wasn’t far from reality: my wedding was to take place just under a year after my brother had gone to the front. And while I was looking for a wedding venue in London, my mind was in the trenches in eastern Ukraine._  
  
And so it focusses on coming to terms with what happens in a nation at war.  _If you have two siblings, and, after one of them dies, people ask you if you have any siblings, what do you answer? Do you say, ‘I have two brothers’? But that’s not true, because one of them is no longer around. ‘I had two brothers. Now I have one, because the other one is dead’? That is technically true, but it’s way too much information. People ask you questions about siblings to be polite; they don’t want to be traumatized by your family history._  
  
A recommended read.  Yet far from a book that sticked with me for long, I'm sad to say.
