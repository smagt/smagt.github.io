description: A brilliant, unforgettable novel from bestselling author Ruth Ozeki, author of The Book of Form and Emptiness Finalist for the Booker Prize and the National Book Critics Circle Award “A time being is someone who lives in time, and that means you, and me, and every one of us who is, or was, or ever will be.” In Tokyo, sixteen-year-old Nao has decided there’s only one escape from her aching loneliness and her classmates’ bullying. But before she ends it all, Nao first plans to document the life of her great grandmother, a Buddhist nun who’s lived more than a century. A diary is Nao’s only solace—and will touch lives in ways she can scarcely imagine. Across the Pacific, we meet Ruth, a novelist living on a remote island who discovers a collection of artifacts washed ashore in a Hello Kitty lunchbox—possibly debris from the devastating 2011 tsunami. As the mystery of its contents unfolds, Ruth is pulled into the past, into Nao’s drama and her unknown fate, and forward into her own future. Full of Ozeki’s signature humor and deeply engaged with the relationship between writer and reader, past and present, fact and fiction, quantum physics, history, and myth, A Tale for the Time Being is a brilliantly inventive, beguiling story of our shared humanity and the search for home.

_A tale for the time being_ by Ruth Ozeki is a very, very beautiful Japanese book.  Seen by a young teenager, Nao, who lives in Tokyo with her unemployed father and her poorly employed mother, her life is no picnic but rather involves street fighting (Japanese style) and dealing with her depressed father.    As with The Night Ship, the story is intertwined with a story about Ruth, living in Canada -- yes, just like the author -- who finds a plastic box washed up on the shore, containing the diary of the girl, and some of her things.    
  
As she tries to help her father and survive in school, she begins to get contact with her grandmother, a Buddhist nun living in a very remote temple, cut off from the world.  Nao starts to visit her, staying for longer periods, and learns her grandmother's life wisdom.  Yes, it's really like that.  And it's really a beautiful concoction of new Japan meets old Japan.       
  
Nao and Ruth connect: Ruth is of Japanese origin, living in Canada; Nao lived with her parents in Silicon Valley before her dad got fired from a tech company, and had her most influential and -- she now things -- most happy years there.  
  
Well, the grandmother dies somewhere in the story, and the parents get saved by managing connecting old and new. That makes Nao's grandmother to be the central figure in the novel; whereas Nao is, of course.  
  
I hope you love this book as much as I did.
