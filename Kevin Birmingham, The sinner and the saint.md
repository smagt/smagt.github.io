description: "The incredible true story behind the creation of a masterpiece of world literature, Fyodor Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment 'A dazzling literary detective story' Guardian In the summer of 1865, the former exile Dostoevsky found himself trapped in a cheap hotel in Wiesbaden, unable to leave until he'd paid the bill. Having lost the last of his money at the roulette table, his debts hung heavy over his head, his epileptic seizures were worsening, and his wife and beloved brother were dead. Desperate, a story came to him, a way to write himself out of his predicament: the murderer Raskolnikov, the hot, disorienting swirl of St Petersburg, the axe, the terrible crime, and the murderer's paranoia. The book was Crime and Punishment, and from the moment it was published it was a sensation. But how did this haunting tale of guilt come to be, and why does it still hold such a sway over us all these years later? The Sinner and the Saint gives us the story of the creation of a work of literature that has bewitched readers for over a century, and of the two men so central to it: Dostoevsky himself, and Pierre François Lacenaire, a notorious murderer and glamorous egoist who charmed and outraged Paris in the 1830s and whose sensational story provided the germ of the novel. As reports of his trial tore through Europe, readers asked themselves: could the instincts of nihilism, the philosophy inspiring a new generation of Russian revolutionaries, also drive a man to murder? Showing how both men's lives were directed by the intoxicating new ideas swirling around Europe in the nineteenth century, The Sinner and the Saint also reveals why they still appal and entice us today. Thrilling and definitive, this is the story of a masterpiece."

Where did Dostojevski get his idea from, to write a story about a murder which, in a certain way, was a good murder?  "The Sinner and the Saint" delves into the dramatic circumstances leading to that. It portrays Dostoevsky's desperate situation in 1865, his gambling losses, and the epiphany for the novel featuring Raskolnikov. 

The book compares Dostoevsky's life with that of Pierre François Lacenaire, a notorious murderer whose trial influenced the novel. It explores themes of guilt, nihilism, and the societal influences of 19th-century Europe, offering a rich narrative on the creation and impact of "Crime and Punishment".  Lacenaire, by the way, died by guillotine at 32, in 1836.

The book explains Russia of the time; it explains the hardships that Dostoyevsky had to suffer.  His time in Siberia (yes, he was involved in some underground activities, basically disagreeing what the Tsar regime did, and free speech was strongly suppressed). Gruesome fact: the trip to Siberia was normally done on foot.  Took a year or two.  For those who arrived, the sentence started after arrival.   

Anyway, Dostoyevsky ended up there, and got to know some criminals. This raised his interest in how murderers think. Hence a spark for his most famous novel.  He suffered from epilepsy, an ill-fated marriage, gambling, and a debt he could never repay. And yet, his research allowed him to reappraise life, despite its hardships.

Worth a read, if you like Dostoyevski's work.
