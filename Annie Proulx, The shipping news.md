description: Winner of the Pulitzer Prize, Annie Proulx’s The Shipping News is a vigorous, darkly comic, and at times magical portrait of the contemporary North American family. Quoyle, a third-rate newspaper hack, with a “head shaped like a crenshaw, no neck, reddish hair...features as bunched as kissed fingertips,” is wrenched violently out of his workaday life when his two-timing wife meets her just desserts. An aunt convinces Quoyle and his two emotionally disturbed daughters to return with her to the starkly beautiful coastal landscape of their ancestral home in Newfoundland. Here, on desolate Quoyle’s Point, in a house empty except for a few mementos of the family’s unsavory past, the battered members of three generations try to cobble up new lives. Newfoundland is a country of coast and cove where the mercury rarely rises above seventy degrees, the local culinary delicacy is cod cheeks, and it’s easier to travel by boat and snowmobile than on anything with wheels. In this harsh place of cruel storms, a collapsing fishery, and chronic unemployment, the aunt sets up as a yacht upholsterer in nearby Killick-Claw, and Quoyle finds a job reporting the shipping news for the local weekly, the Gammy Bird (a paper that specializes in sexual-abuse stories and grisly photos of car accidents). As the long winter closes its jaws of ice, each of the Quoyles confronts private demons, reels from catastrophe to minor triumph—in the company of the obsequious Mavis Bangs; Diddy Shovel the strongman; drowned Herald Prowse; cane-twirling Beety; Nutbeem, who steals foreign news from the radio; a demented cousin the aunt refuses to recognize; the much-zippered Alvin Yark; silent Wavey; and old Billy Pretty, with his bag of secrets. By the time of the spring storms Quoyle has learned how to gut cod, to escape from a pickle jar, and to tie a true lover’s knot.

I read an interview with the author in the FT, and decided to read something by her.  I forgot how I chose this book, but can't complain.  It was a bit of a hard one, directly after the previous book, with more intricate language, a courageous use of adjectives and adverbs; indeed, used in such a way that the characters, which are close to real people, come to life, and be part of one's life.  
  
Well, I liked the book, and I will try to remember to read more by the same author.  The book gives the tale of Quoyle.  He is a reporter in New York state, for some local newspaper.   
  
*A great damp loaf of a body. At six he weighed eighty pounds. At sixteen he was buried under a casement of flesh. Head shaped like a crenshaw, no neck, reddish hair ruched back.*  
  
Quoyle is described as obese and unattractive, and is lucky to find the love of his life with whom he starts to raise their two girls; until his wife Petal, who sleeps with every man she can, dies in a car accident while eloping.    
  
*In the long unfurling of his life, from tight-wound kid hustler in a wool suit riding the train out of Cheyenne to geriatric limper-in-wool-pants down in the sunny town square, Quoyle experienced two accidents of fortune.*  
  
This is where the main part of the story starts: Quoyle, his two daughters, and his aunt emigrate to Newfoundland, which is perhaps remotely comparable to our Hebrides.  It's rough, it's beautiful, it's governed by sea, rain, snow and ice.    
  
*As they rounded a bend in the road they saw ocean ahead and below, as if they were on top of a world consisting mainly of sky.*  
  
and  
  
*He looked at the stone walls streaked with lichen and rust stains, at broken windows, at weedy pavement where plants forced up through cement with muscular patience.*  
  
Their life evolves there, and many things happen but, well, read for yourself.  No huge stories or plots, but the intricate life of people.  In the whole story it was never clear to me how I associated with Quoyle.  I'm not fat; nor did a wife of mine die; nor do I have 2 daughters; nor do I live in the Americas; nor am I a newspaper reporter.  But, he is so human, so real, that indirect associations sort-of come automatically.  As in, yes, I might have done that in that situation.  
  
The language is beautiful in this book (but the figurative use of adjectives may put some people off).  The characters are beautiful, from a humane perspective.  In short, the book is beautiful.
