description: When Euan and Ruth set off with their young daughter to live in Bahrain, it is meant to be an experience and adventure they will cherish. But on the night they arrive, Ruth discovers the truth behind the missionary work Euan has planned and feels her world start to crumble. Far from home, and with events spiralling towards war in nearby Iraq, she starts to question her faith - in Euan, in their marriage and in all she has held dear. With Euan so often away, she is confined to their guarded compound with her neighbours and, in particular, Noor, a troubled teenager recently returned to Bahrain to live with her father. Confronted by temptations and doubt, each must make choices that could change all of their lives for ever. Compelling, passionate and deeply resonant, The Meeting Point is a novel about idealism and innocence, about the unexpected turns life can take and the dangers and chances that await us.

The Meeting Point describes Ruth and Euan Armstrong, and their daughter, going on a missionary expedition to Bahrain. Illegally, they bring bibles for distribution in Saudi Arabia.  
  
While Euan is going about his dangerous business, Ruth is at home, and tries to discover the country with a guide who soon becomes her lover. Infidelity being punishable too, the intricate stories of hiding, secrecy, and illegality develop as the book progresses.  Then there's Noor, the daughter of neighbour in the compound, struggling with her own demons and seeking solace in unexpected places.  
  
The story plays in the wake of the 2001 Iraq war, and perhaps abandonment, disconnectedness and loneliness are central themes. Â   
  
The story itself is sometimes gripping, making the book a quick read.  At the same time, I had difficulty connecting with the story, the backdrop, and the struggles of the main characters.
