description: "A behind-the-scenes history of one of the most successful and admired British sitcoms of the 1980s. In 1977 the BBC commissioned a new satirical sitcom set in Whitehall. Production of its first series was stalled, however, by the death throes of Jim Callaghan’s Labour government and the ‘Winter of Discontent’; Auntie being unwilling to broadcast such an overtly political comedy until after the general election of 1979. That Yes Minister should have been delayed by the very events that helped bring Margaret Thatcher to power is, perhaps, fitting. Over three series from 1980—and two more as Yes, Prime Minister until 1988—the show mercilessly lampooned the vanity, self-interest and incompetence of our so-called public servants, making its hapless minister Jim Hacker and his scheming Permanent Secretary Sir Humphrey two of the most memorable characters British comedy has ever produced. The new prime minister professed it her favourite television programme—a ‘textbook’ on the State in inaction—and millions of British viewers agreed. In the years since Yes Minister has become a national treasure: Sir Humphrey’s slippery circumlocutions have entered the lexicon, regularly quoted by political commentators, and the series’ cynical vision of government seems as credible now as it did thirty years ago. Much of this success can be credited to its writers, Antony Jay and Jonathan Lynn, who drew on their contacts in Westminster to rework genuine political folly as situation comedy. Storylines that seemed absurd to the public were often rooted in actual events—so much so that they occasionally attracted the scrutiny of Whitehall mandarins. In A Very Courageous Decision acclaimed entertainment historian Graham McCann goes in search of the real political fiascos that inspired Yes Minister. Drawing on fresh interviews with cast, crew, politicians and admirers, he reveals how a subversive satire captured the mood of its time to become one of the most cherished sitcoms of Thatcher’s Britain."

I've seen the ancient BBC series 'Yes Minister' and 'Yes Prime Minister' tens of times.  I've read the accompanying books (_The Complete Yes Minister, Anthony Jay & Jonathan Lynn_;  
_The Complete Yes Prime Minister, Anthony Jay & Jonathan Lynn_) about once per decade.  
  
In short, I _love_ this work, since it so much reflects reality, is utterly funny, and totally instructive about politics how it always was and will always be.  
  
Quick reminder: the books describe the tension between politics (Westminster, or Number 10) and the civil servants (Whitehall).  The latter being in charge, the former taking the blame.  The sitcom is old, from the 1980s, and indeed was Thatcher's favourite series, she even played in a short sketch when she was PM.  To me it's always been an eye opener on how politics works; but, again, it's old.  
  
Naturally I figured, when I read of book _A very courageous decision, Graham McCann_, that that's a book for me.  (A 'brave' decision, as Humphrey used to say, was one that would lose you votes, but a 'courageous' one was one that would lose you the election.)  
  
McCann's book was published recently and gives a lot of background information on the series.  Providing a lot of detail and carefully investigated, it describes from the initial concept to the collaboration between its creators, Antony Jay and Jonathan Lynn; the education and background of the authors, and their understanding of British politics.  It also profiles the main actors – Paul Eddington as the well-meaning but often ineffectual Minister Jim Hacker, Nigel Hawthorne as the wily and manipulative Permanent Secretary Sir Humphrey Appleby, and Derek Fowlds as the loyal and pragmatic Principal Private Secretary Bernard Woolley. Through interviews and anecdotes, McCann well describes the dynamics on set and the dedication these actors brought to their roles, a key part of the series being so popular.  
  
McCann also describes the writing process, as to how Jay and Lynn's scripts combined political commentary with comedy, allowing them to satirise the absurdities of government bureaucracy.   
  
Finally, the book describes how the show was received by the public and politicians, and how this influenced the perception of politics and the civil service.   
  
And... it bored me.  Sorry to say that.  A very well-done book.  But it just bored me.  Maybe I'd expected more wit like the book's subject portrays.  Maybe more ingenuity.
