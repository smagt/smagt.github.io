Atwood has the style that suits me: down-to-earth, simple, straightforward.  And the same in this short novel.  Story, really.  

_"You’re so evil,” I said to my mother. I was fifteen, the talk-back age. “I take that as a compliment,” she said. “Yes, I’m evil, as others might define that term. But I use my evil powers only for good.” “Yeah, tell me another,” I replied. We were having an argument about my new boyfriend, Brian. “Anyway, who gets to say what’s good?”_

Brian's gone soon.  The book was written by Atwood shortly after her mother died.  

_There was no sense in going head-to-head with my mother. Nor could I try sneaking around behind her back: she had eyes in the back of her head, and little birds told her things._

Maybe I liked it since it sort of resonates my relationship with my deceased father.  Which was nothing like this relationship! but vexing all the same.  So, this book started shaping my idea how to get to terms with that.  It made me think, that...

But the book, which is between mystery and humour, is really a guide for a mother–daughter relationship.  And how it should not be, or should?

I should to read the book again.  I will, and enjoy it again.
