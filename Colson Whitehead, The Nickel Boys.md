description: NATIONAL BESTSELLER • In this Pulitzer Prize-winning follow-up to The Underground Railroad, Colson Whitehead brilliantly dramatizes another strand of American history through the story of two boys unjustly sentenced to a hellish reform school in Jim Crow-era Florida. When Elwood Curtis, a black boy growing up in 1960s Tallahassee, is unfairly sentenced to a juvenile reformatory called the Nickel Academy, he finds himself trapped in a grotesque chamber of horrors. Elwood’s only salvation is his friendship with fellow “delinquent” Turner, which deepens despite Turner’s conviction that Elwood is hopelessly naive, that the world is crooked, and that the only way to survive is to scheme and avoid trouble. As life at the Academy becomes ever more perilous, the tension between Elwood’s ideals and Turner’s skepticism leads to a decision whose repercussions will echo down the decades. Based on the real story of a reform school that operated for 111 years and warped the lives of thousands of children, The Nickel Boys is a devastating, driven narrative that showcases a great American novelist writing at the height of his powers and “should further cement Whitehead as one of his generation's best" (Entertainment Weekly). Look for Colson Whitehead’s bestselling new novel, Harlem Shuffle!

Colson Whitehead wrote two Pulitzer Prize novels: [Colson Whitehead, The Underground Railroad](./Colson%20Whitehead,%20The%20Underground%20Railroad.md), and this one.  
  
This is a story about a black boy who's unlucky in the US of the 1950s--1970s.   A book with a surprising, beautiful and sad, ending.  In which all's right and all's wrong at the same time. Based on the true (and gruesome) story of the Nickel school, where boys were abused and killed.  
  
We read the story of Elwood Curtis, a young black boy living in Eleanor, Florida, during the time of the Civil Rights Movement. After receiving a record album of speeches by Martin Luther King Jr., Elwood becomes more immersed in the Civil Rights Movement and has high ideals for himself and his community. However, after being arrested for riding in a stolen car, he is sentenced to a reform school called Nickel Academy, where he is subjected to brutal treatment and abuse.  
  
In the prologue, we meet a man named Elwood Curtis who is living in New York City. As a teenager, he attended the Nickel Academy, a reform school in Florida that is now being demolished. He reads in the newspaper that a secret graveyard has been discovered on the grounds and realises that he needs to return to the school and tell his story.  
  
The book is remarkable for having a dual timeline, switching between Elwood's experiences at Nickel and the present-day repercussions of his time there. This works not just to keep you in suspense, but also somehow accentuates the long-lasting effects of trauma. The eventual reveal of Turner's fate is shocking, forcing readers to confront the legacy of such institutions.  
  
_The Nickel Boys_ is more than a historical novel; it deals with America's racist past and a reminder of the work that still has to be done. The novel's tragic ending urges us to remember and act.
