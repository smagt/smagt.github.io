description: "‘A book of pure fineness, exceptional.’ – Diana Evans, Guardian 'A taut, sharp, funny book about being young now. It's brutal—and brilliant.' - Zadie Smith Winner of the Dylan Thomas Prize Shortlisted for the British Book Awards Fiction Debut of the Year Longlisted for the Women's Prize For Fiction Edie is just trying to survive. She’s messing up in her dead-end admin job in her all-white office, is sleeping with all the wrong men, and has failed at the only thing that meant anything to her, painting. No one seems to care that she doesn’t really know what she’s doing with her life beyond looking for her next hook-up. And then she meets Eric, a white middle-aged archivist with a suburban family, including a wife who has sort-of-agreed to an open marriage and an adopted black daughter who doesn’t have a single person in her life who can show her how to do her hair. As if navigating the constantly shifting landscape of sexual and racial politics as a young black woman wasn’t already hard enough, with nowhere else left to go, Edie finds herself falling head-first into Eric’s home and family. Razor-sharp, provocatively page-turning and surprisingly tender, Luster by Raven Leilani is a painfully funny debut about what it means to be young now.

A very recent and debut novel.  A young black women, who starts a relationship with an older white man who says he lives in an open relationship.  Which is true, but with strings attached.  So she by and by becomes intimate with the family, sharing housing, her art (she's good at drawing), raising the adopted child, and such.  Unexpectedly, that part survives the short-lived sexual relationship, and, somehow, all ends well.  Or how does it end, really?    
  
An amazing debut, really; one can only by awed by this writing style.  An afternoon's read; a page-turner.
