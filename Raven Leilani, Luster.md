description: "‘A book of pure fineness, exceptional.’ – Diana Evans, Guardian 'A taut, sharp, funny book about being young now. It's brutal—and brilliant.' - Zadie Smith Winner of the Dylan Thomas Prize Shortlisted for the British Book Awards Fiction Debut of the Year Longlisted for the Women's Prize For Fiction Edie is just trying to survive. She’s messing up in her dead-end admin job in her all-white office, is sleeping with all the wrong men, and has failed at the only thing that meant anything to her, painting. No one seems to care that she doesn’t really know what she’s doing with her life beyond looking for her next hook-up. And then she meets Eric, a white middle-aged archivist with a suburban family, including a wife who has sort-of-agreed to an open marriage and an adopted black daughter who doesn’t have a single person in her life who can show her how to do her hair. As if navigating the constantly shifting landscape of sexual and racial politics as a young black woman wasn’t already hard enough, with nowhere else left to go, Edie finds herself falling head-first into Eric’s home and family. Razor-sharp, provocatively page-turning and surprisingly tender, Luster by Raven Leilani is a painfully funny debut about what it means to be young now. A BEST BOOK OF THE YEAR: Guardian, New York Times, New Yorker, Boston Globe, Literary Hub, Vanity Fair, Los Angeles Times, Glamour, Time, Good Housekeeping, InStyle, NPR, O Magazine, Buzzfeed, Electric Literature, Town & Country, Wired, New Statesman, Vox, Shelf Awareness, i-D, BookPage and more.

A very recent and debut novel.  A young black woman, Edie, starting a relationship with an older white man, Eric, who says he lives in an open relationship.  Well, rule number one in life, dear women out there: don't believe what men say when they want sex.  Nor when they have it.  Only listen _after_ they had it.  
  
But in this case it's sort of true, with strings attached.  So she by and by becomes intimate with the family, sharing housing, her art (she's good at drawing), raising the adopted (black) child, and such.  Unexpectedly, that part survives the short-lived sexual relationship, and, somehow, all ends well.  Or how does it end, really?    
  
Edie is complex and compelling. Her struggles are painfully relatable, from the instability of her job to her grappling with self-worth and identity. Leilani doesn't shy away from describing Edie's flaws, making her a vividly real character. The dynamic between Edie and Eric's wife Rebecca is particularly intriguing, balancing between tension, empathy, and mutual understanding. And it thus touches upon racial disparities and the fetishisation of black bodies.  
  
'Luster' is a searing and unflinchingly honest exploration of modern life, race, and the chaos of being a young adult. Leilani's prose is both raw and poetic, capturing the eclectic nature of Edie with a sharpness that cuts to the bone.  
  
An amazing debut, really; one can only by awed by this writing style.  An afternoon's read; a page-turner.
