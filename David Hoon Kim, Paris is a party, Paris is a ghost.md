description: "In a strangely distorted Paris, a Japanese adoptee is haunted by the woman he once loved When Fumiko emerges after one month locked in her dorm room, she’s already dead, leaving a half-smoked Marlboro Light and a cupboard of petrified food in her wake. For her boyfriend, Henrik Blatand, an aspiring translator, these remnants are like clues, propelling him forward in a search for meaning. Meanwhile, Fumiko, or perhaps her doppelgänger, reappears: in line at the Louvre, on street corners and subway platforms, and on the dissection table of a group of medical students. Henrik’s inquiry expands beyond Fumiko’s seclusion and death, across the absurd, entropic streets of Paris and the figures that wander them, from a jaded group of Korean expats, to an eccentric French widow, to the indelible woman whom Henrik finds sitting in his place on a train. It drives him into the shadowy corners of his past, where his adoptive Danish parents raised him in a house without mirrors. And it mounts to a charged intimacy shared with his best friend’s precocious daughter, who may be haunted herself. David Hoon Kim’s debut is a transgressive, darkly comic novel of becoming lost and found in translation. With each successive, echoic chapter, Paris Is a Party, Paris Is a Ghost plunges us more deeply beneath the surface of things, to the displacement, exile, grief, and desire that hide in plain sight."

A moving book about Henrik, a Danish boy, man, adopted out of Japan, who decides to go to France to learn to be an English <--> French translator.  And loves a Japanese girl there who kills herself.    
  
And so the book has three parts, "Fumiko," "Before Fumiko" and "After Fumiko".  Not a coming-of-age book, but certainly a book in which Henrik comes to terms with what happens in the first part of the book.  Initially, the three parts seem unrelated, but Henrik's pain with life is where it comes together.  His memories with his girlfriends in part 2, also with Fumiko.  But also, is his godchild Gém in part 3 a replacement for Fumiko, in some metaphysical sense?    
  
I liked the book, but I didn't love it.  I do wish Fumiko did not die, that part hurt.  And Gém did not, all fine there, but still a shouting-silent sadness which was not necessary.  As life goes.   
  
Anyway.  Recommended, but I'm ok if you don't read it.
