After some heavier reads, I needed something lighter to cheer me up.  So I chose '_Hard like water_' by Yan Lianke.  "This talent cannot be ignored" says the New York Times.  It's a 2001 book recently translated from Chinese, and it's dark while hilarious.  No, it is not light at all, of course, since it describes the revolution in the late 1960s. The main character, Gao Aijun, who is in his late 20s, and his erotic liaison, Xia Hongmei.  Both are married (to other people).  The two play revolution, while having sex whenever and wherever they can; adultery is not looked upon lightly then and there, since it's bourgeois.  It is hilarious, since the revolution and eroticism (no worries or false hopes, it's not pornographic at all; they call it, "doing that thing") are intertwined and related.  They are in the game for the revolution?  Or for the sex?  It's not clarified, and it's not important.    
  
One has to love Aijun.  One has to love Hongmei.  They are really loving characters, sacrificing theirselves for the revolution -- or for love, whatever.  And they deal with the revolution with, I'd say, eyes wide shut.  Like two children playing a game, albeit a deadly one.   And are successful in it, until...    
  
To celebrate their love, Aijun digs a 550 meter long tunnel between their houses, with a "nuptial chamber" in the middle.  It takes a few years to complete, but it is done.  This is the kind of fantastic realism that this book survives upon; and it is indeed so realistic, that one keeps siding with the heroes, or are they villains, of the story.    
  
The book is not satire, but uses carefully chosen imaging to let the reader embrace the ridicule; or let it be, if one so chooses.     
  
I strongly advise you to read the book, if you feel like a bumpy trip with Mao, Marx, Engels, and two lovebirds.
