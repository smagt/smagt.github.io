This book is often compared with Arthur Golden's "Memoirs of a Geisha". And for a good reason: the topics are almost identical; the narratives are very similar.

But this version has one important different aspect: it is a real autobiography, while Golden wrote a memoir of a Geisha, the genuinity of which is often doubted.

So for that reason alone it must already become at worst the same rating as Golden's book.

And indeed it deserves that. After Golden's, many of the mind-boggling facts of Geisha life are recognisable. Glamour from the outside; pain and abuse from the inside. The war, and in particular post-war Japan, changes Geisha life completely, and Sayo Masuda is in the middle of it, ending up in factory jobs during and servant jobs after the war. 

Not a pretty life. But a true story.  I am happy I read it.
