In this book, expect a sharp critique of the social dynamics between American and European cultures in the late 19th century. Through Daisy Miller, James explores themes of innocence, independence, and the often harsh judgements because of societal norms. The novella’s subtle yet incisive prose captures the complexity of social interactions and the misunderstandings that arise from cultural differences. Free-spirited Daisy challenges the constraints placed on women of her time, making her ahead of her time.  
  
Shuddering.  And not read enough, methinks.
