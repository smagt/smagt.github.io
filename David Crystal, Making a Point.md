"Making a Point: The Pernickety Story of English Punctuation" by David Crystal is a book that explores the history and usage of punctuation in the English language. The book provides practical advice on how to use punctuation effectively to improve writing clarity and coherence. Crystal also delves into the evolution of modern usages, and gently encourages the reader to think in a nuanced way about how marks work rather than imagining that some Platonic style guide, if only it could be accessed, would sort all punctuation decisions into boxes marked “literate” and “illiterate”. The book is an amusing and instructive read for anyone interested in the English language and its history.  
  
I am slowly ploughing my way through David Crystal's work, since he's now my favourite linguist.  I wish I'd known about these 20 years ago, or rather: that he'd written them 20 years ago.  Previously I read his "Making a point", an important book in my opinion, an entertaining book.  Right now I've just started "Spell it out" and "Making sense", more on these later.
