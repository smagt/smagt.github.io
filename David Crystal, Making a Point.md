description: This 'engaging history of punctuation' (Wall Street Journal) is not only the first history of its kind, but a complete guide on how to use English punctuation. Behind every punctuation mark lies a thousand stories. The punctuation of English, marked with occasional rationality, is founded on arbitrariness and littered with oddities. For a system of a few dozen marks it generates a disproportionate degree of uncertainty and passion, inspiring organisations like the Apostrophe Protection Society and sending enthusiasts, correction-pens in hand, in a crusade against error. Professor Crystal leads us through this minefield with characteristic wit, clarity and commonsense. He gives a fascinating account of the origin and progress of every kind of punctuation mark over one and a half millennia, and he offers sound advice on how punctuation may be used to meet the needs of every occasion and context.

I am slowly ploughing my way through David Crystal's work, since he's now my favourite linguist.  I wish I'd known about these 20 years ago, or rather: that he'd written them 20 years ago.  Previously I read his "Making a point", an important book in my opinion, an entertaining book.  Right now I've just started [Spell it out](./David%20Crystal,%20Spell%20it%20out.md) and [Making sense](./David%20Crystal,%20Making%20Sense.md).  
  
*Making a Point* by David Crystal dives into the weird history and everyday use of English punctuation. Each chapter tackles a different punctuation mark, explaining where it came from and how it's changed over time.  
  
Crystal mixes historical tidbits with modern examples, showing how punctuation has evolved. He looks at the old rules and how they've shifted, especially with the rise of printing and digital communication. The book also digs into common punctuation debates, like whether it's okay to use a comma before "and" in a list.  
  
A typical Crystal book: the writing is clear and easy to follow, making it a good read for anyone curious about punctuation. He includes lots of interesting stories and examples to keep things lively.  
  
Overall, *Making a Point* offers a thorough and fun look at punctuation. It's packed with useful info and interesting history, perfect for anyone wanting to understand more about those little marks we use in writing every day.
