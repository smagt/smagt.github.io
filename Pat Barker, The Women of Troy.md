title: The Women of Troy  
author: Barker, Pat  
publishDate: 2021-08-24  
description: A daring and timely feminist retelling of The Iliad from the perspective of the women of Troy who endured it—an extraordinary follow up to The Silence of the Girls from the Booker Prize-winning author of The Regeneration Trilogy and “one of contemporary literature’s most thoughtful and compelling writers" (The Washington Post). Troy has fallen and the victorious Greeks are eager to return home with the spoils of an endless war—including the women of Troy themselves. They await a fair wind for the Aegean. It does not come, because the gods are offended. The body of King Priam lies unburied and desecrated, and so the victors remain in suspension, camped in the shadows of the city they destroyed as the coalition that held them together begins to unravel. Old feuds resurface and new suspicions and rivalries begin to fester. Largely unnoticed by her captors, the one time Trojan queen Briseis, formerly Achilles's slave, now belonging to his companion Alcimus, quietly takes in these developments. She forges alliances when she can, with Priam's aged wife the defiant Hecuba and with the disgraced soothsayer Calchas, all the while shrewdly seeking her path to revenge.

Another beautiful book, recounting of what happened after Troy fell (remember, the wooden horse, with Odysseus leading the troupe of 30ish warriors).  How the Trojan women were enslaved and used after all Trojan men are slaughtered.  And how they keep things running while the (Greek) men drink, play games, and do some random fighting while waiting for the wind to turn and they can return home.  
  
A powerful book, very between-the-lines ridiculing these victorious fighters.  Yes; then, too, the women were in charge, and the men didn't understand.  
  
I enjoyed the book a lot, but of course it's also quite complex, with all of these Trojan women and Greek men, a who's who is always helpful when 10s of people play a role in a book.  Central character is the former Trojan queen Briseis, formerly Achilles' slave/bed partner, now belonging to his companion Alcimus.  She forms alliances with other women where necessary, and so keeps reigning without anyone noticing.  
  
Perhaps I should read it again.  I fear I never will.  Don't get me wrong; it's a very nice book, and recommended read.

After reading [Pat Barker, The Silence of the Girls](./Pat%20Barker,%20The%20Silence%20of%20the%20Girls.md), which a dear friend pointed out to me recently, I decided to go on with the fun ride and reread this book.  
  
And it's still beautiful. Even more so, since I could place the whole story and characters much, much better now.  
  
So, this book follows after the Iliad ends, and of course starts with the trick of entering Troy with a wooden horse filled with Greek warriors. It's all Odysseus' idea, and it's bloody and gross and successful and following the standard procedure: kill all males (including unborn children who may be male); rape all women over an uncertain age (of perhaps 12); then enslave all women, with the prominent ones going to the prominent men (e.g., to King Agamemnon, and Odysseus, the main warrior, and Pyrrhus, Achilles' son (whom he never knew); Odysseus, by the way, is not so much into this part of the game).  
  
Briseis: *Then–and now–people seem to take it for granted that I loved Achilles. Why wouldn’t I? I had the fastest, strongest, bravest, most beautiful man of his generation in my bed–how could I not love him? He killed my brothers. We women are peculiar creatures. We tend not to love those who murder our families.*  
  
Pyrrhus, who is generally seen as a weakling compared to his dad, gains a bit of fame by killing King Priam of Troy. And unjustly so, since Priam was old, feeble, and could hardly bear his weapons and shields. Still, dead is dead.  
  
After their victory, the Greek party, drink, fuck... and the next day, a gale comes from the sea, barring their plans to leave for home immediately.  A wind to stay.  
  
Time goes on. Priam is not buried but left to rot, the wait takes forever. Tensions rise.  
  
The whole story is told by Briseis, the who was married to the son of the king of Lyrnessus – the city which was sacked before the Greek decided to go for Troy (not the queen of Troy, as I said before). Briseis is 19, and carries Achilles' child; she was his slave in the previous book, and then his, well, close to wife. But Achilles, knowing he would die in the fight against Troy, wed her to his closest ally Alcimus. Who, surprisingly, handles her with respect.  
  
Story continues, the Greeks find a way to pacify the Gods, and all's well that ends well.  
  
The burial of Priam comes, and Briseis observes Aachilles'/Pyrrhus' fighters: *Myrmidons: ant-men. I’d always thought what a stupid name that was for men who were so sturdily independent, so ready to question authority, whose respect always had to be earned; but seeing them like this, hearing–and, in the vibration of the cart, feeling–the power and precision of those marching feet, I understood–for the first time, I think–the terror they inspired on the battlefield.*  
  
I can see a third book coming. On how the Troy women, now slaves, including Briseis return to Greece. Troy, I looked it up for you, was in the north-west of current Turkey, some 300km south of Constantinople (Istanbul).  
  
I just hope that Pat Barker sees that third book, too. (Spoiler: after writing this sentence I checked, and indeed!  The Voyage Home, number 3 in the series, is expected in August 2024.)
