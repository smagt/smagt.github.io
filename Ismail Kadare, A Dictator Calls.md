Here's the review from [Kirkus reviews](https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/ismail-kadare/a-dictator-calls/):
> [!NOTE]
> Kadare, Albania’s preeminent poet and novelist, often makes the short list of candidates for the Nobel Prize in Literature, and this slim, melancholy tale is in part about the perils of international acclaim in the shadow of repressive regimes. The core of the story concerns a 1934 phone call Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin made to Boris Pasternak, who had lifelong battles with Soviet leadership. (His most famous work, the 1957 novel _Doctor Zhivago_, was published in the West against the state’s wishes, propelling him to the Nobel.) Stalin called to ask about the dissident poet Osip Mandelstam, who’d been arrested for writing a poem criticizing Stalin. But what exactly was Stalin asking? How did Pasternak respond? And what was Mandelstam critiquing, exactly? The narrator—a Kadare manqué who’s had his own troubles with state censorship—considers the question by exploring the multiple variations of the story of the call. Pasternak’s wife recalls her husband as poised on the phone, requesting Mandelstam’s release; his lover suggests he was more fearful and equivocating. Other versions characterize Pasternak as alternately more timid or defiant, Stalin as more opaque or threatening. “Anybody who takes the plunge in search of the truth, who thinks at first that thirteen versions are too many, may by the end of the case think that these are insufficient!” the narrator writes. But 13 are enough to convey the sense that a writer under totalitarianism has reasons to cloak emotions and massage details, and the variety of stories speaks to how widely Stalin’s intimidation spread. Kadare’s novel is an appealingly plainspoken lament, and Hodgson’s translation captures a somber mood. The run-through of variations leaves the story without an arc, but delivers a strong case against dictatorial meddling in art.

So what _did_ Stalin discuss with Pasternak?  The book highlights many versions, but all of them agree on two facts: Stalin called, and Pasternak reacted inappropriately, failing to defend his arrested colleague Mandelstam.

The book is a prismatic tale reflecting the myriad ways of interpreting a single event, offering 13 perspectives on the conversation's nuances and implications. The novel delves into themes of censorship, fear, and the artist's struggle against totalitarianism, illustrating the pervasive and intimidating reach of Stalin's regime.  And in the end touches upon Kadare's phone call he received from Enver Hoxha, the long-time leader of Albania. During the call, Hoxha congratulated Kadare on a poem recently published in a newspaper. Overwhelmed and cautious, Kadare could only muster repeated thanks in response, signalling to those around him the importance of the call with a mere "thank you" as he was too stunned to engage in further conversation.

So history repeats itself, in a way.  Hoxha not as important as Stalin, and Kadare maybe not as well-known as Pasternak.  But still.

A nice book, my second Kadare and I like his style, his lucid, straightforward and dry way of telling stories.
