description: This is not a comprehensive study of every sexual quirk, kink and ritual across all cultures throughout time, as that would entail writing an encyclopaedia. Rather, this is a drop in the ocean, a paddle in the shallow end of sex history, but I hope you will get pleasantly wet nonetheless. The act of sex has not changed since people first worked out what went where, but the ways in which society dictates how sex is culturally understood and performed have varied significantly through the ages. Humans are the only creatures that stigmatise particular sexual practices, and sex remains a deeply divisive issue around the world. Attitudes will change and grow – hopefully for the better – but sex will never be free of stigma or shame unless we acknowledge where it has come from. Based on the popular research project Whores of Yore, and written with her distinctive humour and wit, A Curious History of Sex draws upon Dr Kate Lister’s extensive knowledge of sex history. From medieval impotence tests to twentieth-century testicle thefts, from the erotic frescoes of Pompeii, to modern-day sex doll brothels, Kate unashamedly roots around in the pants of history, debunking myths, challenging stereotypes and generally getting her hands dirty. This fascinating book is peppered with surprising and informative historical slang, and illustrated with eye-opening, toe-curling and meticulously sourced images from the past. You will laugh, you will wince and you will wonder just how much has actually changed.

No surprises in this one, which I found in the Tate Modern in London and, admittedly, was drawn by the descriptive title.  The book, in short, gives... a curious history of sex.  It describes language and sex; vulvas and vaginas (and explains why the better term is cunt); penises; bread, oysters, and aphrodisiacs; toys including dildos, bicycles and their suspected relationship to female orgasm, and dolls; haircuts; condoms; prostitution; and so on.  Some chapters a bit of an eye-opener; some just curious; other funny.   
  
An amazingly well-researched book (with, of course, sources mentioned where appropriate).  Funny, interesting, entertaining, informative and I'm looking forward to reading Lister's other books, all on similar topics.
