description: "“This book is a breakthrough, a lyrical, powerful, science-based narrative that actually shows us how to get better (much better) at the things we care about.”—Seth Godin, author of Linchpin “Anyone who wants to get better at anything should read [Peak]. Rest assured that the book is not mere theory. Ericsson’s research focuses on the real world, and he explains in detail, with examples, how all of us can apply the principles of great performance in our work or in any other part of our lives.”—Fortune Anders Ericsson has made a career studying chess champions, violin virtuosos, star athletes, and memory mavens. Peak distills three decades of myth-shattering research into a powerful learning strategy that is fundamentally different from the way people traditionally think about acquiring new abilities. Whether you want to stand out at work, improve your athletic or musical performance, or help your child achieve academic goals, Ericsson’s revolutionary methods will show you how to improve at almost any skill that matters to you. “The science of excellence can be divided into two eras: before Ericsson and after Ericsson. His groundbreaking work, captured in this brilliantly useful book, provides us with a blueprint for achieving the most important and life-changing work possible: to become a little bit better each day.”—Dan Coyle, author of The Talent Code “Ericsson’s research has revolutionized how we think about human achievement. If everyone would take the lessons of this book to heart, it could truly change the world.”—Joshua Foer, author of Moonwalking with Einstein"

Normally I hate to read non-fiction books, so much that I don't even know how to call this genre.  But this was a BBC advise, and the topic agrees with my strong belief that Anyone can learn Anything if only you practice well.   
  
Did you  know the origin of the word 'talent'?  It used to be a measure of money, related to a measure of weight of silver or gold. And I think that's much more appropriate than its modern interpretation.  
  
So that is my main reason for liking this book: debunks the myth of 'innate talent' and expounds on 'deliberate practice,' a systematic and often rigorous method of continuously pushing beyond comfort zones.  Ericsson argues that deliberate practice is the key to achieving remarkable levels of performance and expertise. This is illustrated with various real-world examples from different fields such as music, sports, medicine, etc. Ericsson provides practical techniques for individuals to master new skills regardless of age or initial ability level.   
  
So far, so good.  But then, I wish the author condensed it into 30 pages rather than the 300 that this Swedish-born American professor needed, and in which, so I felt, he describes the same case 5 or 6 times.  That's my general complaint with such fact-seeking books ('yes, I got it!  I did!') but in this case I kept at it, and learned something.    
  
So with that conviction, sometimes it's nice to have one's understanding solidified, I only needed to put this 'deliberate practice', ehm, into practice.  And indeed, it didn't take me long to play the opening of the Goldberg Variations to my utter satisfaction.  
  
A good topic.  But a long-winded book.
