description: "** LONGLISTED FOR THE BOOKER PRIZE 2023 ** Meet Jamie and his community on the west coast of Ireland, in the most uplifting and tender book of the year 'Heart-rending and delightful' LOUISE KENNEDY, no.1 bestselling author of Trespasses 'A gorgeous gift of a novel' DOUGLAS STUART, no.1 bestselling author of Shuggie Bain Jamie O'Neill loves the colour red. He also loves tall trees, patterns, rain that comes with wind, the curvature of many objects, books with dust jackets, cats, rivers and Edgar Allan Poe. At age 13 there are two things he especially wants in life: to build a Perpetual Motion Machine, and to connect with his mother Noelle, who died when he was born. In his mind these things are intimately linked. And at his new school, where all else is disorientating and overwhelming, he finds two people who might just be able to help him. How to Build a Boat is the story of how one boy and his mission transforms the lives of his teachers, Tess and Tadhg, and brings together a community. Written with tenderness and verve, it's about love, family and connection, the power of imagination, and how our greatest adventures never happen alone. 'Beautifully rendered and imagined' - Anne Enright 'A heart-stopping read' - Sinéad Gleeson 'Bursting with soul' - Lisa McInerney 'I can't wait for readers to fall in love' - Jan Carson"

Apologies. When Anne Enright says, 'Beautifully rendered and imagined', one may also interpret that as negative criticism because of what Enright does _not_ say in that sentence; but I took it as a recommendation I could pass on. Enright's 'The Wren, The Wren' is amongst my all-time highlights, so this must be a great book, too.  And it got a Booker Prize longlisting on top, so I cannot go wrong.  
  
Right?  
  
Wrong.  
  
When he was 13, there were two things he especially wants in life: to build a Perpetual Motion Machine, and to connect with his mother Noelle, who died when he was born. Felix father's stoicism and his own imagination create an emotional landscape where memories rule.  
  
While Felix's father embodies both protection and distance, friends and local townsfolk shows their own struggles. The boat becomes a symbol – not only of Felix’s inventiveness but also of his desire to navigate through his feelings and reach out to connect with Noelle in some ethereal way. As he works on his project, Felix learns about resilience, acceptance, memory.  
  
Yet despite its potential for depth, "How to Build a Boat" ultimately felt like it drifted along without anchoring itself in profound themes or character development. While I anticipated an exploration akin to Enright’s celebrated works – rich in emotional nuance – I found myself needing more. The writing created vivid imagery; but it often felt as though it was merely skimming the surface rather than going deep.  
  
Perhaps this book is worth reading if you appreciate poetic language – but don’t expect it to anchor you as powerfully as you might wish.  Not for me it did.
