Below is an incomplete list of books I have read in the last few years. I made notes of those books to aid my memory; before, it happened a few times that I unwillingly picked up a book again and then, towards the end of the book, noticed faint familiarity in its contents. 

Caveat lector: These are nothing close to _real_ reviews, such those published by newspapers as the Guardian, the FT, the New Yorker, etc.  Please read those to get a good impression of the book.
