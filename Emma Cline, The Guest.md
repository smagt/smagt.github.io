description: A young woman pretends to be someone she isn’t in this stunning novel by the New York Times bestselling author of The Girls. “Alex drained her wineglass, then her water glass. The ocean looked calm, a black darker than the sky. A ripple of anxiety made her palms go damp. It seemed suddenly very tenuous to believe that anything would stay hidden, that she could successfully pass from one world to another.” Summer is coming to a close on the East End of Long Island, and Alex is no longer welcome. A misstep at a dinner party, and the older man she’s been staying with dismisses her with a ride to the train station and a ticket back to the city. With few resources and a waterlogged phone, but gifted with an ability to navigate the desires of others, Alex stays on Long Island and drifts like a ghost through the hedged lanes, gated driveways, and sun-blasted dunes of a rarefied world that is, at first, closed to her. Propelled by desperation and a mutable sense of morality, she spends the week leading up to Labor Day moving from one place to the next, a cipher leaving destruction in her wake. Taut, propulsive, and impossible to look away from, Emma Cline’s The Guest is a spellbinding literary achievement.

Alex is 22. And she survives. Coming from a challenging background, she convinces wealthier men, like Simon, to have her around for a longer time. Sometimes successfully, sometimes less so. And the book starts when Simon throws her out, as he thinks she's getting too intimate with one of his friends. Rightly so. Or not?

We follow Alex sleeping on the beach, sleeping in a squatted house with an underage boy, and wherever she can, until she manages to get back to Simon; after all, his kicking her out was all a mistake.

Wasn't it?

I did not relate all that well to the sorrows of a 22-year-old girl, who lives her life between opportunism, sugarbabe, and dependence. And still is a strong character, mind you, knowing how to get what she wants.

Often.

_She smiled but felt that the smile wasn’t reaching her eyes._ You know, such sentences which are made to make you pause and think, and you do, and you get not an inch further. Or this one, _The boy who came over was tall, Germanic looking, with features that seemed approximate, like they had been drawn from memory._ Not sure what effect Cline is looking for here. If it's irritation, that worked.

For me, easy come, easy go, this book. I may have missed a hidden message. But as it is, I cannot recommend it.
