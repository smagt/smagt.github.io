description: "WINNER OF THE PULITZER PRIZE • THE EMMY AWARD–WINNING HBO MINISERIES STARRING FRANCES MCDORMAND, RICHARD JENKINS, AND BILL MURRAY In a voice more powerful and compassionate than ever before, New York Times bestselling author Elizabeth Strout binds together thirteen rich, luminous narratives into a book with the heft of a novel, through the presence of one larger-than-life, unforgettable character: Olive Kitteridge. At the edge of the continent, Crosby, Maine, may seem like nowhere, but seen through this brilliant writer’s eyes, it’s in essence the whole world, and the lives that are lived there are filled with all of the grand human drama–desire, despair, jealousy, hope, and love. At times stern, at other times patient, at times perceptive, at other times in sad denial, Olive Kitteridge, a retired schoolteacher, deplores the changes in her little town and in the world at large, but she doesn’t always recognize the changes in those around her: a lounge musician haunted by a past romance: a former student who has lost the will to live: Olive’s own adult child, who feels tyrannized by her irrational sensitivities; and Henry, who finds his loyalty to his marriage both a blessing and a curse. As the townspeople grapple with their problems, mild and dire, Olive is brought to a deeper understanding of herself and her life–sometimes painfully, but always with ruthless honesty. Olive Kitteridge offers profound insights into the human condition–its conflicts, its tragedies and joys, and the endurance it requires.

I ended with a quick dive in Olive Kitteridge (Elizabeth Strout).  After the first, edging-on-erotic, but also dream-based chapter I found it is a selection of loosely connected stories.  I decided not to read the second story.  Next adventure is the Brontë sisters, I think.  I only read Wuthering Heights, but in my student days, and forgot all about it except for the warm glow it gives.

The first one I have been working on, yes it felt like working on, was _Olive Kitteridge_.  An acclaimed book by Elizabeth Strout, and it inspired her to write a follow-up.  

Now, the fun thing is, I wanted to buy this book before, perhaps last year, or earlier this year.  And when I found out it is a collection of short stories (I do not care for that genre), I tossed the idea aside. 

Recently I encountered the book again, was less careful, purchased, and read.  

It's a collection of short stories!  I discovered.  And then things began to dawn on me.  Well, that's how my brain works.   

Now, it's not as bleak as it sounds.  It is indeed short stories, but they are all about Olive Kitteridge.  In the first chapter, which is actually a nice story (and which I read before in a preview), it's mostly about Olive's husband, and his assistant in his pharmacy.  They have a loving relationship (no, no adultery or something; he just takes care of her as a good friend; she is young, unexperienced, and experiences some adversarial situations, like a deceased husband).  Olive is slightly jealous, but that's not a theme.  

The book goes on.  Her husband retires in a next chapter, and other people are in the focus.  And on and on, two elderly people lovingly living together – with Olive being the less friendly, more critical one, and Henry the more congenial chap.  Then the slow path towards the end of life, taking old ripples in relationship on one's shoulder... and on it goes.  

Yes, of course, it's very well written, the character development – what this book lives off – is something like unique.  One gets to know Olive quite well.  

But still, I was bored, and had to plough through the text.  There were no surprising endings, no things to look ahead to, nothing to keep the reader even emotionally attached to the protagonist.  Or nists.  

I ended the book, with a sigh I must add, and decided not to get the sequel.  I doubt not that others see this book much more positively, also acknowledging that I don't really can put my negative view in words.
