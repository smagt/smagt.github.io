This book is a favourite of mine now.  The "Dutch" has nothing to do with my choice, nor with the contents of the book.  It's about a brother and sister growing up (the brother is the narrator).  The book follows their early childhood until death, and central is the Philadelphia "VanHoebeek house".    
  
The book is something like a modern fairytale, and if it's not yet a movie it will soon be.  Perhaps with Meryl Streep playing the mother who is absent for 4/5 of the book?

I liked it. At the same time, I forgot much of it except some scenes, of the children in their adult years. Maybe, one day, I pick it up again.

Ann Patchett's "The Dutch House" tells the story of siblings Danny and Maeve Conroy, who grow up in a grand estate near Philadelphia. Their lives change dramatically when their father remarries, and their stepmother eventually forces them out of their home. The mother?  She's mostly absent.  Absent for her young children; and later, when she resurfaces, absent in her children's affection.  The novel spans five decades, focusing on how the siblings cope with their past and their enduring connection to the house.  
  
The Dutch House itself is a central symbol in the novel, representing both lost wealth and a constant reminder of the past. This grand estate has a significant influence on Danny and Maeve, affecting their decisions and their relationship.  Not because of the place, but the people that belong with it.  
  
Strong characters make the book such a pleasure to read.  The writing is clear and effective, engaging and accessible.
