This book is a favourite of mine now.  The "Dutch" has nothing to do with my choice, nor with the contents of the book.  It's about a brother and sister growing up (the brother is the narrator).  The book follows their early childhood until death, and central is the Philadelphia "VanHoebeek house".  

The book is something like a modern fairytale, and if it's not yet a movie it will soon be.  Perhaps with Meryl Streep playing the mother who is absent for 4/5 of the book?

I liked it. At the same time, I forgot much of it except some scenes, of the children in their adult years. Maybe, one day, I pick it up again.
