description: Feyi Adekola feels every time she locks eyes with the one person in the house who is most definitely off-limits. Who is she ready to become? Can she release her past and honor her grief while still embracing her future? And, of course, there's the biggest question of all-how far is she willing to go for a second chance at love?

**You made a fool of death with your beauty** by Akwaeke Emezi is a Sunday Times bestseller.  Not sure why.  Yes, it's a happy-go-easy book, a woman who lost her lover in a car accident rediscovers love and sex through several men, until she lands with one.  I quickly read it, I even faster forgot it.  Something like, a holiday evening-in-a-tent read or so.  At least that's how I used it.
