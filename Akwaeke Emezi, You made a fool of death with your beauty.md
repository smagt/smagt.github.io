**You made a fool of death with your beauty** by Akwaeke Emezi is a Sunday Times bestseller.  Not sure why.  Yes, it's a happy-go-easy book, a woman who lost her lover in a car accident rediscovers love and sex through several men, until she lands with one.  I quickly read it, I even faster forgot it.  Something like, a holiday evening-in-a-tent read or so.  At least that's how I used it.

**You made a fool of death with your beauty** by Akwaeke Emezi is a Sunday Times bestseller.  Not sure why.  Yes, it's a happy-go-easy book, a woman who lost her lover in a car accident rediscovers love and sex through several men, until she lands with one.    
  
The book starts with Feyi Adekola  in a bathroom at a house party, fucking Milan, a man she just met. A turning point in Feyi's life, as it is the first time she has been with someone since her husband's fatal car accident five years earlier. Milan, attractive and eager, represents a convenient step for Feyi in her trip to reconnect with her desires and move forward from her grief.  
  
And so she does. She soon meets Nasir Blake, a charming and patient young man. Their relationship appears promising but remains platonic initially. Nasir's interest in Feyi leads to an invitation to the Caribbean, where the novel's pace and Feyi's romantic life both take significant turns. In the Caribbean, Feyi encounters Nasir’s father, Alim,a celebrated chef, and unexpectedly finds herself drawn to him. This love triangle becomes the heart of the story, and the reader bets it all: forbidden love, loyalty, sex, personal healing. The relationship between Feyi and Alim defies societal expectations and personal boundaries, where Alim's need for sex exceeds his respect for his son.  
  
I quickly read it, I even faster forgot it.  Something like, a holiday evening-in-a-tent read or so.  At least that's how I used it.  If you don't mind a cliché-driven story, well, it at least has its entertaining bits.
