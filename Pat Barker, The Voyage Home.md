description: "The exhilarating follow-up to Pat Barker's The Women of Troy and The Silence of the Girls After ten blood-filled years, the war is over. Troy lies in smoking ruins as the victorious Greeks fill their ships with the spoils of battle. Alongside the treasures looted are the many Trojan women captured by the Greeks – among them the legendary prophetess Cassandra, and her watchful maid, Ritsa. Enslaved as concubine – war-wife – to King Agamemnon, Cassandra is plagued by visions of his death – and her own – while Ritsa is forced to bear witness to both Cassandra’s frenzies and the horrors to come. Meanwhile, awaiting the fleet’s return is Queen Clytemnestra, vengeful wife of Agamemnon. Heart-shattered by her husband’s choice to sacrifice their eldest daughter to the gods in exchange for a fair wind to Troy, she has spent this long decade plotting retribution, in a palace haunted by child-ghosts. As one wife journeys toward the other, united by the vision of Agamemnon’s death, one thing is certain: this long-awaited homecoming will change everyone’s fates forever. ‘The queen of literary historical fiction, Barker is an unflinching guide for a trip across ancient Greece’ National Geographic ‘In her thrilling retelling of the stories of Cassandra and Clytemnestra, Barker conjures up a world stained by the grief of mothers and daughters. Agamemnon’s palace is the stuff of nightmares, a world of suspicion and fear, plagued by the ghosts of innocents’ Paula Hawkins 'You go to her for plain truths, a driving storyline and a clear eye, steadily facing the history of our world' Guardian"

After [The Silence of the Girls](./Pat%20Barker,%20The%20Silence%20of%20the%20Girls.md) and [The Women of Troy](./Pat%20Barker,%20The%20Women%20of%20Troy.md), both of which I liked tremendously, Barker finishes (?) her trilogy (?) with the story of how Agamemnon goes home to Greece with his concubine, or new wife, Cassandra, the oldest unmarried daughter of king Priam -- who was slaughtered in Troy, of course, as all other born and unborn men.  
  
How to figure out if an unborn is male?  Don't take a chance.  
  
Agamemnon comes home to his first wife, Clytemnestra, whose oldest daughter he sacrificed to get good winds to sail to Troy, ten years earlier.  She would have been Cassandra's age now.  
  
Her daughter?  Yes, his, too.  Reason enough for Clytemnestra to desire his death.  And in Cassandra's visions, exactly that will happen, but her own will happen just as well.    
  
The whole story is told my Cassandra's maid, Ritsa, whom we know from the previous books, and where she played a secondary role.  Ritsa had also learned to be a healer in Troy, something that comes in handy in many a situation.  
  
The story evolves, culminates, and ends.  
  
Again, I love this book.  Barker's trilogy is often criticised for using language and words that is not appropriate for a period of 4000 years ago.  For me, that's part of the books' magic.  Of course, people have horses, ride carriages, and sail.  It's an old story.  But they are still people, have sex, kill, love, eat, bathe, and putting that in a language that is common to us extends rather than limits, in my opinion.  
  
Like Ritsa thinking,  
  
_‘What sort of life? Just thinking about it makes me feel sick – his brat sucking my tits like a bloody leech? No, thanks. You know when your friend Briseis came to see me? Do you remember? Well, I looked at her belly and I thought, That’s Achilles’ child in there. He murdered her brothers, he murdered her husband – and there she is, carrying his baby.’_  
  
And Cassandra saying,   
  
_‘Lord Agamemnon will have a swift and safe voyage home.’ She was speaking in a Daddy’s-little-girl voice, the kind that some men find mysteriously attractive and makes every woman within earshot want to slap you. ‘The gods require it.’_  
  
Ritsa observing Greeks going to the market is possibly as authentic then as it would be now:  
  
_They were on their way to choose a slave; apparently, some of the Trojan women were being sold off cheap. Or free, for tenant farmers. ‘Mind,’ the woman was saying, ‘I don’t want a fancy piece with big tits, I want a good strong girl who’s not afraid of a bit of hard work.’ Her husband, who was quite a bit older than her, with a slack mouth and receding chin, kept saying, ‘Yeah, yeah, right.’ Meaning: Shurrup, woman, for god’s sake, I know what I’m doing._  
  
Great storytelling by Barker.  I cannot imagine a fourth book following these three; the story feels complete now.  Even though, of course, the coming home of Odysseus was not told, or any of the other 'heroes' of the Trojan wars.  Having given the other two books a rating of 10 out of 10, this one goes down to 9, and I think it's just because of me.  
  
Beautiful.  Read it.
