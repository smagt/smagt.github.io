description: "The powerful and moving memoir of a fearless political opposition leader who paid the ultimate price for his beliefs. Alexei Navalny began writing Patriot shortly after his near-fatal poisoning in 2020. It is the full story of his life: his youth, his call to activism, his marriage and family, his commitment to challenging a world super-power determined to silence him, and his total conviction that change cannot be resisted—and will come. In vivid, page-turning detail, including never-before-seen correspondence from prison, Navalny recounts, among other things, his political career, the many attempts on his life, and the lives of the people closest to him, and the relentless campaign he and his team waged against an increasingly dictatorial regime. Written with the passion, wit, candor, and bravery for which he was justly acclaimed, Patriot is Navalny’s final letter to the world: a moving account of his last years spent in the most brutal prison on earth; a reminder of why the principles of individual freedom matter so deeply; and a rousing call to continue the work for which he sacrificed his life. “This book is a testament not only to Alexei’s life, but to his unwavering commitment to the fight against dictatorship—a fight he gave everything for, including his life. Through its pages, readers will come to know the man I loved deeply—a man of profound integrity and unyielding courage. Sharing his story will not only honor his memory but also inspire others to stand up for what is right and to never lose sight of the values that truly matter.&quot; —Yulia Navalnaya"

Watch his [Oscar-premiered movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navalny_(film)). Then read this book.  
  
At least, that's how I did it. The movie impacted me greatly. There is some overlap between the documentary and the book, but only so much to make you understand the order of events in Navalny's life and death better.  
  
Published after Alexei Navalny's death on Feb 16, 2024, and finished while he was in prison, the book is humorous, and of course tragic. As he wrote himself, "The book’s author has been murdered by a villainous president; what more could the marketing department ask for?"  
  
Just... read it.
