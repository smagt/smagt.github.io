description: Winner of the Pulitzer Prize in Fiction Shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize New York Times Bestseller A New York Times Notable Book and a Washington Post, Time, Oprah Magazine, Newsweek, Chicago Tribune, and Kirkus Reviews Best Book of 2018 "The best novel ever written about trees, and really just one of the best novels, period." —Ann Patchett The Overstory, winner of the 2019 Pulitzer Prize in Fiction, is a sweeping, impassioned work of activism and resistance that is also a stunning evocation of—and paean to—the natural world. From the roots to the crown and back to the seeds, Richard Powers’s twelfth novel unfolds in concentric rings of interlocking fables that range from antebellum New York to the late twentieth-century Timber Wars of the Pacific Northwest and beyond. There is a world alongside ours—vast, slow, interconnected, resourceful, magnificently inventive, and almost invisible to us. This is the story of a handful of people who learn how to see that world and who are drawn up into its unfolding catastrophe.

_The overstory_ starts of with a number of unconnected life stories of people, families, with the only common thing being a tree, or trees, central to their lives.  Gradually these stories all come together, and the whole book embarks on an epic of the characters, whom we have appreciated in the previous chapters, saving trees.  All previously disconnected characters go do tree setting, chaining themselves to trees, and anything in their power to prevent (which seems to never work) or slowen their slaughtering.

While I do feel influenced by the apparent facts in the book, I grew increasingly irritated by the longwindedness of the story.  The continued repeats of plots and events made me bored out of my wits, and just managed to read 2/3s or about 400 pages of the book, before finally deciding to put it down.  The book may have caught me on the wrong foot, and I may have to give it another chance.  Whenever my reviews are negative, it's probably my fault!    
  
And in this case, with a Pulitzer Prize and Ann Patchett, whose books I like or love, saying it's one of the best novels – I apologise for my stupidity.  
  
I will revisit this book.  Until then, my low rating – as always – just indicates my connectedness with the book, and must not be misunderstood as a quality measure of this.
