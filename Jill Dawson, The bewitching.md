description: "'OUR MOST CONSUMMATE HISTORICAL NOVELIST' Philip Hoare 'Brilliant' Paula Hawkins 'Breathtaking' Sadie Jones 'Devastating' The Times 'Terrific' Mail on Sunday 'Chilling' Daily Express A dazzling, shocking novel that speaks to our times, drawing on the 16th-century case of the witches of Warboys. Alice Samuel might be old and sharp-tongued, but she's no fool. Visiting her new neighbours in her Fenland village, she finds Squire Throckmorton's family troubled and, she suspects, not as God-fearing as they seem. Yet when one of the daughters accuses her of witchcraft, Alice has no idea of the danger she is in or how quickly matters will escalate. The Throckmortons' maid Martha, uneasy herself about strange goings-on in the household, is reluctant to believe that Alice is a witch. But as the entire village gets swept up in the frenzied persecution of one of their own, she struggles to find a voice . . .

One of those rare books which I liked once I finished it. The bewitching is a historically rich account of the famous Witches of Warboys, on which you will find many online resources, including a wiki page failing lots of verification. And thus one suspects this version of the story to be more truthful.  
  
England, 16th century. The families of Cromwell and Throckmorton against Alice Samuel, her daughter, and her husband. The former have, following legal practice of the days, sufficient evidence that Alice is a witch, and suspect beyond reasonable doubt that so do said daughter and husband.   
  
Naturally the story is abundantly sad, and the author instrumentalises one of the maids in the Throckmorton household as narrator to obtain that sentiment.   
  
As fascinating the story is -- in fact, it is my second historic witch book in a few years -- I did have my trouble to dig into the book, at least the first half. I found things easier once the focus shifted from the Throckmorton girls, lord, and lady to Alice, when she was given a face from part IV. I then started to understand the drama in the tale, the cause of the trouble,  and all that. It irritated me a bit that the author started presenting Alice as a bit of a simpleton, but perhaps that has historic validity. But if not: it saddened me beyond necessity.  
  
The story, being historic, doesn't end well, of course. And perhaps too sudden:  
  
_And thus ye have the story of the three witches of Warboys. If any be desirous to know the present state of the children, how they are and how they have been since the death of these parties, you shall understand that not any of them have had any fit at all, but have all of the them been in as perfect health as ever from their birth._   
  
followed by:  
  
_It is not the whole truth, what the pamphlet says. I’m reading it now, from our new home, in Ellington. Not one of them have had any fit at all . . . in perfect health . . . No, this is not the truth._  
  
A recommended read?  I don't know you well enough to answer that.  But I'd never dare to say that this book is not well-written.  Feel like feeling taken back into the kitchen of a 16th century mansion?  In 20th century language? This book is for you.
