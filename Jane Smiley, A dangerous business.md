description: "From the Pulitzer Prize-winning, best-selling author of A Thousand Acres: An amazing “mash-up of a Western, a serial-killer mystery and a feminist-inflected tale of life in a bordello” (The Washington Post). In 1850s Gold Rush California two young prostitutes, best friends Eliza and Jean, attempt to find their way in a lawless town on the fringes of the Wild West—a bewitching combination of beauty and danger—as what will become the Civil War looms on the horizon. “Everyone knows that this is a dangerous business, but between you and me, being a woman is a dangerous business, and don’t let anyone tell you otherwise...&quot; Monterey, 1851. Ever since her husband was killed in a bar fight, Eliza Ripple has been working in a brothel. It seems like a better life, at least at first. The madam, Mrs. Parks, is kind, the men are (relatively) well behaved, and Eliza has attained what few women have: financial security. But when the dead bodies of young women start appearing outside of town, a darkness descends that she can't resist confronting. Side by side with her friend Jean, and inspired by her reading, especially by Edgar Allan Poe’s detective Dupin, Eliza pieces together an array of clues to try to catch the killer, all the while juggling clients who begin to seem more and more suspicious. Eliza and Jean are determined not just to survive, but to find their way in a lawless town on the fringes of the Wild West—a bewitching combination of beauty and danger—as what will become the Civil War looms on the horizon.

A quick read, and a beautiful story.    That dangerous business is, being a woman.  I am quoting a review from The Guardian in the below paragraph:  
  
_Eliza is not sorry when her husband dies. Peter Cargill is 20 years older than his 18-year-old bride, and persuades her parents back in Kalamazoo, Michigan, that he will be a tender and supportive spouse. But as they chase the gold rush and head out west, the opposite turns out to be the case. The year is 1851, and there is little recourse for Eliza against his cruelties: “He had made it clear that he intended to put it to her, whether she liked it or not, once or twice every day.” So when he’s shot in a bar fight in Monterey, it’s a relief. But how will the young widow support herself? Fortunate, then, that one Mrs Parks offers her work in a brothel. The place is spacious, with a nice veranda, “and the first fellow who came to her treated her much more kindly than Peter ever had”._  
  
So, Eliza being our hero.  She is naive, smart, and extremely straightforward and calculative.  Non-emotional up to silliness, I would argue.  Which makes her a very attractive hero.  So, a short while into the book she becomes a prostitute and enjoys it, it being a good way to keep her safe and with enough money to have an acceptable life.  The rest is some business which neither hurts nor pleasures her.  And with a friend, who works in a Monterey brothel for women (did that exist?) she solves a sequence of murders, many of which are colleagues.  
A very nice book.  Perhaps inconsequential.  I'm none the wiser afterwards.  But much recommended, if you are looking for some _divertimento_.

A quick read, and a beautiful story.   That dangerous business is, being a woman.  Eliza and her husband, 20 years her senior, go west for the gold rush.  The year is 1851, and Eliza at 18 does not have an easy time countering her husband's cruel behaviour towards her:  
  
_He had made it clear that he intended to put it to her, whether she liked it or not, once or twice every day._  
  
Eliza is not sorry when her husband dies.  Indeed, when he’s shot in a bar fight in Monterey, it’s quite a relief. But how will the young widow support herself? Fortunate, then, that one Mrs. Parks offers her to work in a brothel. The place is spacious, with a nice veranda, _“and the first fellow who came to her treated her much more kindly than Peter ever had”._  
  
Eliza is portrayed as naive, smart, extremely straightforward and calculative.  Non-emotional up to silliness, I would argue.  Which makes her a very attractive hero.    
  
She enjoys being a prostitute, it being a good way to keep her safe and with enough money to have an acceptable life. More freedom than the average woman in those days. The rest is some business which neither hurts nor pleasures her.  And with her friend Jane, who works in a Monterey brothel for women, she begins to solve a series of murders, in particular since many of the victims are former colleagues.  
  
A very nice book.  Perhaps inconsequential.  I may be none the wiser afterwards.  But much recommended, if you are looking for some _divertimento_.
