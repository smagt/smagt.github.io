description: Young Ismail's world centres around his mother. Naïve and fragile as a paper doll, she is an unlikely presence in her husband's imposing house, with its hidden rooms and infamous dungeon. Yet despite her youthful nature, she is not without her own enigmas. Most of all, she fears that her intellectual, radical son will exchange her for a superior mother when he becomes a famous writer. From the winner of the first ever Man Booker International Prize, this is a disarming story of home and creative ambition, of personal and political freedom. Rooted in the author's own childhood in Albania, it is dedicated to the memory of his mother.

The Doll, by the Albanian writer Kadare.  Who is Albania's most famous living author, I read, and not that I know any others, but I understand why.    
  
The doll is the mother, the main character of the book, fragile, hating the wonderful house her husband brings her to, and being remarkedly absent in the story.  People live, people die, but the doll is always there, and never there.    
  
The most beautiful part, perhaps, of this novel is how fitting the title is.  The English one, that is; I never checked the Albanian one.    
  
Note to self: get to know Kadare better.
