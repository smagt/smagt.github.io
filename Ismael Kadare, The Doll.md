description: Young Ismail's world centres around his mother. Naïve and fragile as a paper doll, she is an unlikely presence in her husband's imposing house, with its hidden rooms and infamous dungeon. Yet despite her youthful nature, she is not without her own enigmas. Most of all, she fears that her intellectual, radical son will exchange her for a superior mother when he becomes a famous writer. From the winner of the first ever Man Booker International Prize, this is a disarming story of home and creative ambition, of personal and political freedom. Rooted in the author's own childhood in Albania, it is dedicated to the memory of his mother.

The Doll, by the Albanian writer Kadare.  Who is Albania's most famous living author, I read, and not that I know any others, but I understand why.    
  
The doll is the mother, the main character of the book, fragile, hating the wonderful house her husband brings her to, and being remarkedly absent in the story.  People live, people die, but the doll is always there, and never there.    
  
The most beautiful part, perhaps, of this novel is how fitting the title is.  The English one, that is; I never checked the Albanian one.    
  
Note to self: get to know Kadare better.  
=======
In this  book, an English translation of which I read, Kadare mixes fiction with memoir.  It's normal to write about one's parents, right? Which author didn't.  But perhaps somewhat remarkable that Kadare did it so late in his career.  He himself serves as both narrator and protagonist, talking about his youth, his literary ambitions, and the ways his mother’s presence and absence shaped his life. And yes, the difficult relationship between a mother and her son is central in the story.  In this case, in an Albania that undergoes strong political changes, this is also supported by generational, cultural, political gaps.    
  
The doll, of course, is the mother, the main character of the book, fragile, hating the wonderful house her husband brings her to, and being remarkedly absent in the story.  People live, people die, but the doll is always there, and never there.    
  
And thus, the title is perfect.  
  
I liked the book.
