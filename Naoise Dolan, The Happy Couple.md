description: "'I am fully in awe of Dolan's talent' DOUGLAS STUART 'A dazzling follow-up to Exciting Times' KATHERINE HEINY 'Beautiful' PANDORA SYKES Meet the wedding party: THE BRIDE AND GROOM Celine and Luke are meant to get married and live happily ever after. But Celine's more interested in playing the piano, and Luke's a serial cheater. THE BRIDESMAID Phoebe, Celine's sister, is meant to finish college and get a real job. Instead she pulls pints, lives with six flatmates, and has no long-term aspirations beyond smoking her millionth cigarette. THE BEST MAN Archie, Luke's best friend and ex-boyfriend, is meant to move up the corporate ladder and on from Luke. Yet he stands where he is, admiring the view. THE GUEST Vivian, Luke's other best friend and other ex, was meant to put up with Luke's bullshit when they dated. But she didn't. And now she is contented, methodically observing her friends like ants. As the wedding approaches and these five lives intersect, each character will find themselves looking for a path to their happily ever after - but does it lie at the end of an aisle?"

A about relations, about love, about life. It describes Celine and Luke. Celine is a concert pianist with considerable success, but not at the level of Martha Argerich. Luke, her to-be-husband: _"Bridesmaid who hadn’t fucked Luke. That was how Phoebe remembered who Ró was. If that didn’t tell you everything you needed to know about Luke –"_.  

But Luke is, somehow, not central to the story. Neither is Celine. They are, but they aren't. It's more about the people, characters, around them. _"Although Madame Esmeralda hated other felines, she cherished her humans for their opposable thumbs. They were lousy gymnasts and alarmingly hairless, but they opened her chicken cans, and that was not nothing."_  

(Quoting the Guardian here) _Dolan’s narratives are casually bisexual, cracking open marriage-plot narratives – less love triangle, more sex pentangle – with bed-hopping that’s neither transgressive nor redemptive but simply a fact of life._ 

Well, you should read the Guardian's reviews in general, not mine. They are better.  

I liked the book. But a week after finishing it I had to be reminded what it's about again. The title does not really stick, even when the couple is not happy at all. The fact that Celine is a concert pianist excited me, and I could pretend to relate to her absent-mindedness, her focussing on piano above anything else, even when the glove wearing is – I think – a bit ridiculous. I related less to Luke, and indeed could say there is some character development missing in the book. But then that made to me, well, Luke a bystander of the story of his life.  

In the end, everyone loses. And everyone wins. A ripple in the void.
