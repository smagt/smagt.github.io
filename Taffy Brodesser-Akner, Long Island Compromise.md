description: "'Everything I was dreaming it would be - shocking, tender, profound and delicious' EMILY MAITLIS 'Both enjoyable and funny while also substantive and profound' CATHY RENTZENBRINK From the Sunday Times bestselling author of Fleishman Is in Trouble comes Long Island Compromise, a darkly exhilarating novel about an American family and its inheritance - the safety and wealth that they fought for, and the precarity of their survival that is their legacy. In 1980, a wealthy businessman named Carl Fletcher is kidnapped from his driveway in the nicest part of the nicest part of Long Island. He is brutalised, held for ransom and then returned to his family. Miraculously, Carl, his wife and his three kids are left to move on with their lives, and resume their prized places in the ongoing saga of the American dream. But nearly forty years later, when Carl's mother dies, the trauma that has been bubbling beneath the Fletchers' lives all this time surfaces at last. It becomes apparent that Carl has been quietly pursuing closure to the kidnapping for all these years, and his wife and children must face that the money that they believed bought them safety was actually never capable of doing any such thing. Long Island Compromise spans generations, winding through decades of history all the way through to the wild present, dealing along the way with all the mainstays of American Jewish life and the timeless questions about wealth, trauma, and the American soul. PRAISE FOR FLEISHMAN IS IN TROUBLE: 'This is the novel of the summer . . . There is no one that this book isn't for. I can't believe it's a first novel. Pure brilliance' INDIA KNIGHT, THE SUNDAY TIMES 'Could be one of the books of my entire lifetime. I've never felt so seen' GRACE DENT, GUARDIAN 'Sharp and wicked, insightful and funny, and then suddenly so touching' DAVID NICHOLLS 'This book is a work of utter perfection' ELIZABETH GILBERT"

_DO YOU WANT to hear a story with a terrible ending? On Wednesday, March 12, 1980, Carl Fletcher, one of the richest men in the Long Island suburb where we grew up, was kidnapped from his driveway on his way to work._  
  
This is how this family saga book opens.  And goes on, strongly, for the next 500+ pages.  Not a page where the story isn't gripping, the writing isn't inviting.  I love this book from the first to the last sentence.   Reason enough to also get Brodesser-Akner's first novel, which was already filmified. This one will be, too.  
  
OK, the story. This Jewish family, the Fletchers, consists of grandpa (long dead) who started the styrofoam factory grandma Phyllis who is there till the end but dies half-way, mother Ruth, father Carl, and the children Beamer, Nathan, and Jenny.  
  
The book opens with the kidnapping.  It closes with it.  And is present all the time.  That's what kidnappings do, probably.  
  
_For those agents had perfunctorily sniffed around for women and car accidents and nervous breakdowns, almost out of politeness, but they had taken one look at this house—the largest on a block of extremely robbable homes, the deck that reached over the Long Island Sound like the Sound was their own personal swimming pool, their own personal swimming pool, the crescent driveway, the modern appliances, the marble bathrooms, the velvet couches, a Jaguar XJ6 (Ruth’s) in the driveway._  
  
Beamer, Nathan, and Jenny (unborn during the kidnapping) have a constant need to re-enact, or distance, or connect to family because of what happened.  Carl's mind never returns. Ruth is permanently everywhere and nowhere.    
  
As in Beamer's way to cope, through sex and drugs excesses, hiding those from his society wife Noelle:  
  
_As Noelle came to define his status quo, he now sought the opposite of Noelle: messy where Noelle was neat; dirty where Noelle was groomed; a sphincter that was warm and purple and inviting where Noelle’s was pink like a ballerina, hairless, puckered in rebuke, and just about sealed shut._  
  
Nathan has a job but is not successful:  
  
_Nathan hadn't been fired—not exactly, anyway. Or at least not formally; at least not yet. He was on what was technically called “unpaid administrative leave” while he waited for a panel of his superiors to convene to determine the level of discipline he’d earned when he’d totally accidentally and yet somehow intentionally bribed a government official._  
  
Ruth sometimes deplores her life choices, don't we all:  
  
_Dale picked a fight with her on the ride home that night. She couldn’t remember now exactly what it was about—probably the usual fight about him wanting to marry immediately and her wanting to wait till graduation—except that she saw clearly that he was asking for a reaffirmation of her love in all the ways that men do, meaning indirectly._  
  
Yes.  We do.  And we know that women are right, but don't act on it to keep up appearances:  
  
_There has never been, in the history of all human interaction, a way for a woman to explain effectively that she’s calm when a man has suggested she isn’t._  
  
(I skipped Jenny's story, leaving it to you to discover the smartest, most distanced of the family – and as important as any of the others.)  
  
And so we follow the lives of each of the characters, chapter by chapter.  Stories so full, so real, that it's as fascinating to be in one, as move to the other.  Since they all connect. I often use the term 'character development', well, here that's done on steroids.   
  
The author is kind enough to give us all information on the kidnapping, and in the end we can make a decent guess as to how it came to be.    
  
Where are your skeletons?  
  
  
Read the book, people.
