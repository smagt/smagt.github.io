description: "'There are some stories that require as much courage to write as they do art. Peter Ho Davies's achingly honest, searingly comic portrait of fatherhood is just such a story . . . The world needs more stories like this one, more of this kind of courage, more of this kind of love.' - Sigrid Nunez, National Book Award-winning author of The Friend When does sorrow turn to shame? When does love become labour? When does chance become choice? And when does fact become fiction? A Lie Someone Told You About Yourself traces the complex consequences of one of the most personal yet public, intimate yet political, experiences a family can have: to have a child, and conversely, the decision not to have a child. A woman's first pregnancy is interrupted by test results at once catastrophic and uncertain, leaving her and her husband, a writer, reeling. A second pregnancy ends in a fraught birth, a beloved child, the purgatory of further tests - and questions that reverberate down the years. This spare, supple narrative chronicles the flux of parenthood, marriage, and the day-to-day practice of loving someone. As challenging as it is vulnerable, as furious as it is tender, as touching as it is darkly comic, Peter Ho Davies's new novel is an unprecedented depiction of fatherhood."

Have you ever been pregnant?  
  
Good chance your doctor suggested some tests on the foetus; such tests are more seriously suggested with increasing maternal age.  
  
So _if_ you do such tests, what's then?  Suppose the tests suggest that all is not ok, what do you do?  
  
This book visits that impossible situation, based on what the author actually went through. A couple decides, based on chromosome tests, to discontinue a pregnancy.  The book describes the mental horror, in a very dry, factual way.    
  
"How do you mourn something you killed?" The novelty of the book is: it's a man's story.  Therein unique, worthwhile, and a gem.  The couple, by the way, later get a son, who has to suffer his parents' hypertension, thinking he's mortally ill with every small issue.  But I'm exaggerating: the book is observational, descriptive, and not emotional.  That makes it powerful.    
  
A book for parents.  Not for aspiring ones.
