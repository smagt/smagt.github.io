description: Helen Grant is a mystery to her daughter. An extrovert with few friends who has sought intimacy in the wrong places; a twice-divorced mother-of-two now living alone surrounded by her memories, Helen (known to her acquaintances as 'Hen') has always haunted Bridget. Now, Bridget is an academic in her forties. She sees Helen once a year, and considers the problem to be contained. As she looks back on their tumultuous relationship - the performances and small deceptions - she tries to reckon with the cruelties inflicted on both sides. But when Helen makes it clear that she wants more, it seems an old struggle will have to be replayed. From the prize-winning author of First Love, My Phantoms is a bold, heart-stopping portrayal of a failed familial bond, which brings humour, subtlety and new life to the difficult terrain of mothers and daughters.

I did a quick one, with "_My Phantoms_"  by Gwendoline Riley.  Her 7th novel, published 2021, after winning or being nominated for a number of prizes, albeit not the big ones.  I know none of her other works.

"My Phantoms" seems autobiographic, but probably isn't.  Bridget, the main character, has a difficult relationship with her divorced parents.  Her father, whom she loathed, died many years ago; her mother, whom she loathes, dies towards the end of the book.  Loathed?  Perhaps indifference is more correct.  Yes, her parents are weird, but who isn't?  Nothing totally out-of-the-normal, I'd say.  But Bridget's extremely cold, keeping-distance relationship with her parents (her mother, most of the book) is alienating.  Or with her sister, for that matter; distant.  Who's at "fault" here?    
  
We are never relieved of the facts, of what happened in Bridget's childhood. If anything did at all.  There is some reference to something, but it dies with the mother.

A book like real life.  Gripping.  But also, quick.  I liked it more than I expected, and I forgot it as quickly as projected.
