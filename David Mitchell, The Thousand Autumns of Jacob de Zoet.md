description: "'ONE OF THE MOST BRILLIANTLY INVENTIVE WRITERS OF THIS, OR ANY, COUNTRY' INDEPENDENT Shortlisted for the James Tait Black Memorial and Commonwealth Writers' Prizes 'Thrillingly suspenseful' SUNDAY TIMES 'Stunning' INDEPENDENT ON SUNDAY 'Brilliant' THE TIMES 'Entirely original' OBSERVER 'A classic' WASHINGTON POST The Sunday Times Number One bestseller from the author of Cloud Atlas and Utopia Avenue In your hands is a place like no other: a tiny, man-made island in the bay of Nagasaki, for two hundred years the sole gateway between Japan and the West. Here, in the dying days of the eighteenth century, a young Dutch clerk arrives to make his fortune. Instead he loses his heart. Step onto the streets of Dejima and mingle with scheming traders, spies, interpreters, servants and concubines as two cultures converge. In a tale of integrity and corruption, passion and power, the key is control - of riches and minds, and over death itself.

You know, I read this book, upon a recommendation by a close person.  They read it in Dutch, but I ventured the original version, of course, me preferring to read books in English where I can.  And should.  
  
So did.  And this book, first of all, I learned a lot about a part of Japanese/Dutch history which was completely new to me.  Turn of the 18th century, in the Edo period, only the Dutch were allowed to trade with Japan, since they appeared to be the only ones who did not also want to force Christianity on the Japanese.  Before that, Japan had violently kicked out the Portuguese who could not help spreading their religion.  Didn't sit well, and the Dutch were the winners.  
  
But in this book, that trade post in Nagasaki bay is already established, and frayed by corruption.  Jacob de Zoet comes in to clean up, and a romantic involvement with a Japanese midwife ensues.  Not good, of course.  
  
Well, I should save our time and instead let you read this brilliant review https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/may/09/thousand-autumns-jacob-zoet-mitchell.    
  
Done?  Back here, then I can only add, go read this book.  It's wonderful.
