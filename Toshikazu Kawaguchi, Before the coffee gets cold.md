description: "*NOW AN LA TIMES BESTSELLER* *OVER ONE MILLION COPIES SOLD* *AN INTERNATIONAL BESTSELLER* If you could go back in time, who would you want to meet? In a small back alley of Tokyo, there is a café that has been serving carefully brewed coffee for more than one hundred years. Local legend says that this shop offers something else besides coffee—the chance to travel back in time. Over the course of one summer, four customers visit the café in the hopes of making that journey. But time travel isn’t so simple, and there are rules that must be followed. Most important, the trip can last only as long as it takes for the coffee to get cold. Heartwarming, wistful, mysterious and delightfully quirky, Toshikazu Kawaguchi’s internationally bestselling novel explores the age-old question: What would you change if you could travel back in time? Meet more wonderful characters in the sequel to Before the Coffee Gets Cold, Tales from the Café, and the third book in the series, Before Your Memory Fades, releasing November 15, 2022!"

You may know my fascination with magic realism.  And many Japanese authors take this a step further, and well, yes, I have a weakness for such Japanese books.  
  
Setting, very simple: some cafe in some Japanese city.  With a few regulars, a few random visitors, an owner and her personnel.  Mostly recurring characters as one would expect in such a place in Japan; but each chapter in the book is a separate story, only connected to the others in that the setting is the same.  
  
The cafe has one chair, always occupied by one woman.  But when she leaves (for the toilet), others can quickly take the seat and travel back in time.  Caveat: be back before the coffee gets cold, or else you end up in that chair forever.  And that one woman is freed, finally.  
  
A somewhat artificial setting, but then also in-a-Japanese-way-credible, setting for a set of very emotional, personal stories about people, relationships, loves lost, and so on and so forth.  
  
A beauty.  Read it.
