description: In a single short book as elegant as it is wise, Ian Buruma makes sense of the most fateful span of Japan’s history, the period that saw as dramatic a transformation as any country has ever known. In the course of little more than a hundred years from the day Commodore Matthew Perry arrived in his black ships, this insular, preindustrial realm mutated into an expansive military dictatorship that essentially supplanted the British, French, Dutch, and American empires in Asia before plunging to utter ruin, eventually emerging under American tutelage as a pseudo-Western-style democracy and economic dynamo. What explains the seismic changes that thrust this small island nation so violently onto the world stage? In part, Ian Buruma argues, the story is one of a newly united nation that felt it must play catch-up to the established Western powers, just as Germany and Italy did, a process that involved, in addition to outward colonial expansion, internal cultural consolidation and the manufacturing of a shared heritage. But Japan has always been both particularly open to the importation of good ideas and particularly prickly about keeping their influence quarantined, a bipolar disorder that would have dramatic consequences and that continues to this day. If one book is to be read in order to understand why the Japanese seem so impossibly strange to many Americans, Inventing Japan is surely it.

**Inventing Japan** by Ian Burema.  A book on the history of Japan between 1853 and 1964.  In 1853, before which Japan was closed for foreigners (except for a single Dutch trading post; I learned about that in The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet; perhaps I reported elsewhere), a fleet of American ships with cannons forced Japan open for trade.  They sought, I think, a place to store their treasures or replenish their ships or something.  At least it worked, and a new part of Japanese history, away from the samurai state with capitals Kyoto (the capital to the west, where the divine emperor resided) and Tokyo (the capital to the east, where the shoguns, leading the Samurai, resided).  I may be wrong in the details -- I recite all of this from memory and I read this book a while ago -- but the principle is rightish.   The book explains the trip from Geisha Japan to a state in which the Emperor did not stop the state it was in WW2, or may even have supported it (no one really wants to know).  I think the book gives a good start in understanding why Japan is such a strange country, wedged until today between the old and the new.  Recommended read, but not always a ball.
