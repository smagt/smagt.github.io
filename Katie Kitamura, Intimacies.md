description: "A NEW YORK TIMES TOP 10 BOOK OF 2021 LONGLISTED FOR THE 2021 NATIONAL BOOK AWARD IN FICTION ONE OF BARACK OBAMA’S FAVORITE 2021 READS AN INSTANT NATIONAL BESTSELLER A BEST BOOK OF 2021 FROM Washington Post, Vogue, Time, Oprah Daily, New York Times, Los Angeles Times, San Francisco Chronicle, Atlantic, Kirkus and Entertainment Weekly “Intimacies is a haunting, precise, and morally astute novel that reads like a psychological thriller…. Katie Kitamura is a wonder.” —Dana Spiotta, author of Wayward and Eat the Document “One of the best novels I’ve read in 2021.” – Dwight Garner, The New York Times A novel from the author of A Separation, an electrifying story about a woman caught between many truths. An interpreter has come to The Hague to escape New York and work at the International Court. A woman of many languages and identities, she is looking for a place to finally call home. She's drawn into simmering personal dramas: her lover, Adriaan, is separated from his wife but still entangled in his marriage. Her friend Jana witnesses a seemingly random act of violence, a crime the interpreter becomes increasingly obsessed with as she befriends the victim's sister. And she's pulled into an explosive political controversy when she’s asked to interpret for a former president accused of war crimes. A woman of quiet passion, she confronts power, love, and violence, both in her personal intimacies and in her work at the Court. She is soon pushed to the precipice, where betrayal and heartbreak threaten to overwhelm her, forcing her to decide what she wants from her life."

The book is a relatively simple story about a, perhaps, 30-ish woman who got a job offer as French translator in the international court in Den Haag. She accepts, moving there from New York (which her mother just left for Singapore) to accept her one-year appointment.   
  
The reader learns a few idiosyncrasies of the court, as well as of the translator's job there, as she moves between less and more high-profile cases. And interacts with several, rather shallow, relationships or friendships with several locals.    
  
The book itself I found rather shallow. The title baffles, as there seem not to be many intimacies. The protagonist's relationship with a married man, who's in separation, is cold and confusing -- also for her -- and her there-partner's character does not develop in the story. Just like the female friend she has earlier in the book, who slowly disappears.    
  
The quietness of the novel can be enjoyed.  Still, I failed to understand the depth.
