description: Sinuously constructed in four interlocking parts, Paul Auster's fifteenth novel opens in New York City in the spring of 1967, when twenty-year-old Adam Walker, an aspiring poet and student at Columbia University, meets the enigmatic Frenchman Rudolf Born and his silent and seductive girfriend, Margot. Before long, Walker finds himself caught in a perverse triangle that leads to a sudden, shocking act of violence that will alter the course of his life. Three different narrators tell the story of Invisible, a novel that travels in time from 1967 to 2007 and moves from Morningside Heights, to the Left Bank of Paris, to a remote island in the Caribbean. It is a book of youthful rage, unbridled sexual hunger, and a relentless quest for justice. With uncompromising insight, Auster takes us into the shadowy borderland between truth and memory, between authorship and identity, to produce a work of unforgettable power that confirms his reputation as "one of America's most spectacularly inventive writers."

“Invisible” is a novel by Paul Auster, published in 2009. The story follows the life of Adam Walker, a student at Columbia University in 1967, who meets a visiting Swiss professor, Rudolf Born. Born offers him money to found and run a literary magazine. Walker then sleeps with Margot, Born’s girlfriend, for “five straight nights” while Born is away. The novel deals with questions of shifting identity, puzzles and illusion, a persistent sense of dread, and of characters feeling trapped by circumstances over which they have no control.  
  
Riveting, magic story.  Good read.   
=======
Adam Walker, a young aspiring poet in 1967 New York City, meets a Frenchman, Rudolf Born, and his girlfriend, Margot, at a party. Born offers to fund a literary magazine for Walker, leading to a series of events that change Walker's life.  
  
In the first part, Walker tells his initial encounters with Born and Margot, whom he fucks, leading to a mixture of fascination and distrust towards Born.  
  
In the second part, Walker moves to Paris to escape the turmoil of his experiences in New York. There, he becomes incestuously involved with his sister, Gwyn.  
  
The third part is a memoir written by Walker years later, reflecting on the events of 1967 and their impact on his life. This section introduces Jim, an old college friend who receives Walker's manuscript and tries to uncover the truth about Walker's experiences.  
  
The final part returns to the present, with Jim visiting Gwyn to learn more about Walker's later years and his unresolved feelings about Born and Margot. This conclusion ties together the various parts of the story, showing the lasting influence of past events on the characters' lives.  
  
How do _you_ create your identity? How do _your_ choices affect your life? A riveting, magic story. And an Auster great read. Note to self, I must reread this.
