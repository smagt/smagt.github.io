description: "WINNER OF THE 2022 PULITZER PRIZE FOR FICTION 2021 NATIONAL JEWISH BOOK AWARD WINNER A NEW YORK TIMES NOTABLE BOOK OF 2021 A WALL STREET JOURNAL BEST BOOK OF 2021 A KIRKUS BEST FICTION BOOK OF 2021 &quot;Absorbing, delightful, hilarious, breathtaking and the best and most relevant novel I’ve read in what feels like forever.&quot; —Taffy Brodesser-Akner, The New York Times Book Review Corbin College, not quite upstate New York, winter 1959–1960: Ruben Blum, a Jewish historian—but not an historian of the Jews—is co-opted onto a hiring committee to review the application of an exiled Israeli scholar specializing in the Spanish Inquisition. When Benzion Netanyahu shows up for an interview, family unexpectedly in tow, Blum plays the reluctant host to guests who proceed to lay waste to his American complacencies. Mixing fiction with nonfiction, the campus novel with the lecture, The Netanyahus is a wildly inventive, genre-bending comedy of blending, identity, and politics that finds Joshua Cohen at the height of his powers."

As the author writes, "Ben-Zion Netanyahu... which meant nothing to me, or to anyone... not even the surname, which was still a generation from its infamy."  Mixed feelings along the way, but: also a wonderful book, mainly because of its wit.  Story: small college town in New York, faculty of history.  The main character, Ruben Blum, is a (Jewish!) professor of history, new at the college.  Whenafter he should head the selection committee for a new professor, by the name of the book, who is expert on mediaeval Iberian Jewish history.  And a charlatan, so it seems, but a convincing one.     
  
The entering of Blum in the college is already funny, and enjoyable (but, I think, you must appreciate Jewish humour).  But culminates when Netanyahu's visit occurs and erupts in a slapstick-like tale of family, lost, lust, and culture.     
  
Most vivid, I think, are the women in the book.  The grandmothers of the Blums, while the fathers drool away in idiocy.  The daughter, whose main goal is a nose job.  Mrs. Blum as well as Mrs. Netanyahu, two women as opposite as could be, running the show out of grudge.    
  
My appreciation of the book grew per page.  The surprising end -- not spoiling here -- unbefitting to a 1950s story.  And then, the major Oh!, when learning that the book is based on some historical facts.  It sheds a clear light on things which happened in 2024 in the real world.  
  
The language is often intricate.  I even skipped a page or two, when a discourse of Jewish catholicism followed, and could follow the story after.  Serious business! now and then.  Still: recommended; I am very happy I read it.
