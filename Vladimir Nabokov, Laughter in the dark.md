Not really sure when this was written, but of course reading up a bit about Nabokov's history is worth it.  Paraphrasing: he left Petersburg, with his parents, fleeing from the Bolsjeviks, ended up studying in Cambridge, later in his life went to the US to teach Russian literature in smaller colleges and larger universities, I think Cornell.  
  
And, one of my favourite writers.  I don't know if I read this book a few decades ago.  Quite possible, since in my twenties I wanted to read all of his work save Lolita – did not want to go mainstream.  I loved that when I was about as old as the protagonist, what was his name, Humbert, and love that book of his above all.  
  
But this is about another book, which a bit serves as a prequel to Lolita.  Sugar daddies, beware!  You may think twice after reading this book.  
  
Here, Albinus, who lives in Berlin with his complacent wife Elisabeth and their daughter Irma, is well off and leads a boring life.  He wants more excitement, more passionate sex, and decides to get a young girl to give him that.  Albinus being quite timid and not used to snugging up to women takes a long time to find what he's looking for, but ends up with a cinema usher, Margot.  She must be 18 or thereabouts, and knows how to play her frivolity to get from Albinus what she wants.  Which is, out of her drab life, away from poverty and her abusive family.  
  
Short version: she succeeds.  Longer version: go read it yourself.  Quite a few complications along the way, both for Albinus, Margot, and of course also Elisabeth.  
  
What more can I say?  It's Nabokov.  I have some female friends who did not really enjoy reading Lolita.  They might enjoy this one more, perhaps, because here at least the women have the upper hand.  And so, the end is tragic.
